okay     I 

00:00:14.869   00:00:14.879  
okay well I thought this time that I
 

00:00:14.879   00:00:16.519  
okay well I thought this time that I
would   the  

00:00:16.519   00:00:16.529  
would   actually cover some of the
  

00:00:16.529   00:00:21.380  
would   actually cover some of the 
   a  

00:00:21.380   00:00:21.390  
   hopefully a
  

00:00:21.390   00:00:24.739  
   hopefully a
number     time     I'm  

00:00:24.739   00:00:24.749  
number of them as I   I'm
  

00:00:24.749   00:00:27.829  
number of them as I   I'm
going     fast  

00:00:27.829   00:00:27.839  
going   to go through this while as fast
  

00:00:27.839   00:00:30.380  
going   to go through this while as fast
as     I     as  

00:00:30.380   00:00:30.390  
as I   am able to I want to do it as
  

00:00:30.390   00:00:32.900  
as I   am able to I want to do it as
completed     course  

00:00:32.900   00:00:32.910  
completed job as possible and of course
 

00:00:32.910   00:00:34.550  
completed job as possible and of course
   through  

00:00:34.550   00:00:34.560  
   I'll get through
  

00:00:34.560   00:00:36.950  
   I'll get through
the     we'll  

00:00:36.950   00:00:36.960  
the entire   Bible is very low but we'll
  

00:00:36.960   00:00:38.720  
the entire   Bible is very low but we'll
get     lot     stories  

00:00:38.720   00:00:38.730  
get   the major stories
  

00:00:38.730   00:00:40.130  
get   the major stories
in     good  

00:00:40.130   00:00:40.140  
in the beginning of   it and that's a good
  

00:00:40.140   00:00:42.860  
in the beginning of   it and that's a good
start     that  

00:00:42.860   00:00:42.870  
start and then you know assuming that
 

00:00:42.870   00:00:44.390  
start and then you know assuming that
   try  

00:00:44.390   00:00:44.400  
  this all goes well then maybe I'll try
  

00:00:44.400   00:00:45.980  
  this all goes well then maybe I'll try
to     the  

00:00:45.980   00:00:45.990  
to do the same   thing again either in the
  

00:00:45.990   00:00:50.540  
to do the same   thing again either in the
fall     or     that  

00:00:50.540   00:00:50.550  
fall or   so assuming I'm that
  

00:00:50.550   00:00:52.160  
fall or   so assuming I'm that
everything     still     properly  

00:00:52.160   00:00:52.170  
everything is still   out properly
  

00:00:52.170   00:00:54.740  
everything is still   out properly 
   all  

00:00:54.740   00:00:54.750  
   all
  

00:00:54.750   00:01:02.690  
   all 
   last  

00:01:02.690   00:01:02.700  
  right so I guess we'll start so last
  

00:01:02.700   00:01:06.140  
  right so I guess we'll start so last
week     the  

00:01:06.140   00:01:06.150  
week I talked to you   about a line in the
  

00:01:06.150   00:01:08.120  
week I talked to you   about a line in the
New     Testament     it  

00:01:08.120   00:01:08.130  
New Testament   John and it
  

00:01:08.130   00:01:10.069  
New Testament   John and it
was     designed     parallel  

00:01:10.069   00:01:10.079  
was a line that   to parallel
  

00:01:10.079   00:01:12.469  
was a line that   to parallel
the    a  

00:01:12.469   00:01:12.479  
the   opening of Genesis and it's it's a
  

00:01:12.479   00:01:14.719  
the   opening of Genesis and it's it's a 
   I  

00:01:14.719   00:01:14.729  
  really important line and I thought I
  

00:01:14.729   00:01:20.389  
  really important line and I thought I
would     Bible  

00:01:20.389   00:01:20.399  
would re-emphasize it because the   Bible
  

00:01:20.399   00:01:22.849  
would re-emphasize it because the   Bible
is     been     forward  

00:01:22.849   00:01:22.859  
   written forward
  

00:01:22.859   00:01:24.889  
   written forward
and     in     like  

00:01:24.889   00:01:24.899  
and backwards in   sense like
  

00:01:24.899   00:01:26.450  
and backwards in   sense like
most     books     book  

00:01:26.450   00:01:26.460  
most books   because if you write a book
  

00:01:26.460   00:01:27.919  
most books   because if you write a book 
   if  

00:01:27.919   00:01:27.929  
   course when you get to the end if
  

00:01:27.929   00:01:29.179  
   course when you get to the end if
you're     the  

00:01:29.179   00:01:29.189  
you're the writer you can adjust the
 

00:01:29.189   00:01:31.399  
you're the writer you can adjust the
beginning     odd 

00:01:31.399   00:01:31.409  
beginning and so on so it has this odd
 

00:01:31.409   00:01:33.980  
beginning and so on so it has this odd
it     appearance    but  

00:01:33.980   00:01:33.990  
it has this appearance   of linearity but
  

00:01:33.990   00:01:35.870  
it has this appearance   of linearity but
it     like  

00:01:35.870   00:01:35.880  
it   really it isn't linear it's like
  

00:01:35.880   00:01:38.090  
it   really it isn't linear it's like 
   standing  

00:01:38.090   00:01:38.100  
  you're God in some sense standing
  

00:01:38.100   00:01:40.399  
  you're God in some sense standing
outside    you  

00:01:40.399   00:01:40.409  
outside   of time that's your book and you
  

00:01:40.409   00:01:43.300  
outside   of time that's your book and you
can     play     and

  it gives the story odd parallels in in
  

00:01:56.490   00:01:58.459  
  it gives the story odd parallels in in
many     number

many many   places in a very large number

  but of course it depends on what exactly 
   a

   by the cosmos when you make a
statement     there's  

00:04:27.740   00:04:27.750

me deeply   the idea that what

me deeply   the idea that what
it     is  

00:06:06.410   00:06:06.420  
it   is that we do as human beings is is
  

00:06:06.420   00:06:08.900  
it   is that we do as human beings is is 
   and  

00:06:08.900   00:06:08.910  
  encounter something like a formless and
  

00:06:08.910   00:06:10.730  
  encounter something like a formless and
potential     not  

00:06:10.730   00:06:10.740  
potential chaos   I mean we're not
  

00:06:10.740   00:06:12.530  
potential chaos   I mean we're not 
   just  

00:06:12.530   00:06:12.540  
   just
  

00:06:12.540   00:06:14.840  
   just
do     a  

00:06:14.840   00:06:14.850  
do whatever we   want but we encounter a
  

00:06:14.850   00:06:17.450  
do whatever we   want but we encounter a
formless     that's  

00:06:17.450   00:06:17.460  
formless and chaotic potential that's
 

00:06:17.460   00:06:19.340  
formless and chaotic potential that's
   and  

00:06:19.340   00:06:19.350  
  always what we're grappling with and
  

00:06:19.350   00:06:21.710  
  always what we're grappling with and
somehow     consciousness     give

  like if you look at how they regard
themselves     you

fundamental part of   the brain it that
responds    the  

00:07:29.500   00:07:29.510  
responds   which is the

  possibility of accruing something new
  

00:07:31.490   00:07:33.370  
  possibility of accruing something new
and     valuable     potential  

00:07:33.370   00:07:33.380  
and valuable   it responds to potential
  

00:07:33.380   00:07:35.800  
and valuable   it responds to potential
with     and  

00:07:35.800   00:07:35.810  
with active movement forward   and
  

00:07:35.810   00:07:38.080  
with active movement forward   and
engagement     the  

00:07:38.080   00:07:38.090  
engagement   and so we're engaged in the
  

00:07:38.090   00:07:39.640  
engagement   and so we're engaged in the
world     like  

00:07:39.640   00:07:39.650  
world as potential and looks like
 

00:07:39.650   00:07:42.250  
world as potential and looks like
   there's  

00:07:42.250   00:07:42.260  
   so there's
  

00:07:42.260   00:07:44.740  
   so there's
this     idea     idea  

00:07:44.740   00:07:44.750  
this idea   the main idea
  

00:07:44.750   00:07:46.480  
this idea   the main idea
that     in  

00:07:46.480   00:07:46.490  
that I   think is being put forth in
  

00:07:46.490   00:07:49.120  
that I   think is being put forth in 
   you  

00:07:49.120   00:07:49.130  
  Genesis one it's something like and you
  

00:07:49.130   00:07:51.700  
  Genesis one it's something like and you
see     mythology     from  

00:07:51.700   00:07:51.710  
see   like from from
  

00:07:51.710   00:07:53.260  
see   like from from
what     I've     there's  

00:07:53.260   00:07:53.270  
what I've   gather there's
  

00:07:53.270   00:07:55.510  
what I've   gather there's
always     elements     make  

00:07:55.510   00:07:55.520  
always three causal elements   that make
  

00:07:55.520   00:07:58.240  
always three causal elements   that make
up     the     world  

00:07:58.240   00:07:58.250  
up being at the   bottom of world
  

00:07:58.250   00:08:00.400  
up being at the   bottom of world
mythology     formless  

00:08:00.400   00:08:00.410  
mythology and one is the formless
 

00:08:00.410   00:08:03.160  
mythology and one is the formless
potential     it's 

00:08:03.160   00:08:03.170  
potential that makes up being once it's
 

00:08:03.170   00:08:04.420  
potential that makes up being once it's
interacted     and    generally  

00:08:04.420   00:08:04.430  
interacted with and   that's generally
  

00:08:04.430   00:08:06.970  
interacted with and   that's generally 
   think  

00:08:06.970   00:08:06.980  
   nature and I think
  

00:08:06.980   00:08:08.950  
   nature and I think 
   from  

00:08:08.950   00:08:08.960  
  that's because it's like the source from
  

00:08:08.960   00:08:11.650  
  that's because it's like the source from 
   it's  

00:08:11.650   00:08:11.660  
   all things emerge and rise it's
  

00:08:11.660   00:08:13.300  
   all things emerge and rise it's
something    more  

00:08:13.300   00:08:13.310  
something   like that it's more
  

00:08:13.310   00:08:14.620  
something   like that it's more 
   something  

00:08:14.620   00:08:14.630  
   that but it's something
  

00:08:14.630   00:08:16.330  
   that but it's something 
   of  

00:08:16.330   00:08:16.340  
  like that and then there's some kind of
  

00:08:16.340   00:08:18.220  
  like that and then there's some kind of
interpretive     to  

00:08:18.220   00:08:18.230  
interpretive structure that has to
 

00:08:18.230   00:08:20.590  
interpretive structure that has to
grapple   and  

00:08:20.590   00:08:20.600  
grapple   with that formless potential and
  

00:08:20.600   00:08:22.480  
grapple   with that formless potential and
that's     think     thing  

00:08:22.480   00:08:22.490  
that's I think   that's the sort of thing
  

00:08:22.490   00:08:24.550  
that's I think   that's the sort of thing
that     by     Conklin  

00:08:24.550   00:08:24.560  
that was   Conklin
  

00:08:24.560   00:08:26.440  
that was   Conklin
when     that  

00:08:26.440   00:08:26.450  
  when he was criticizing the notion that
  

00:08:26.450   00:08:28.510  
  when he was criticizing the notion that 
   sense  

00:08:28.510   00:08:28.520  
   from sense
  

00:08:28.520   00:08:30.310  
   from sense
data     which     empirical  

00:08:30.310   00:08:30.320  
data which   would be the pure empirical
  

00:08:30.320   00:08:32.170  
data which   would be the pure empirical
perspective     you  

00:08:32.170   00:08:32.180  
perspective   right because when you
  

00:08:32.180   00:08:34.360  
perspective   right because when you
encounter     it  

00:08:34.360   00:08:34.370  
encounter the world   you encounter it
  

00:08:34.370   00:08:36.430  
encounter the world   you encounter it
with     already  

00:08:36.430   00:08:36.440  
with a cognitive   structure that already
  

00:08:36.440   00:08:39.430  
with a cognitive   structure that already
has     already     you  

00:08:39.430   00:08:39.440  
has shape and so it's   in you
  

00:08:39.440   00:08:41.830  
has shape and so it's   in you
this     that     priori  

00:08:41.830   00:08:41.840  
this structure and without that   a priori
  

00:08:41.840   00:08:43.300  
this structure and without that   a priori
structure     be     take  

00:08:43.300   00:08:43.310  
structure you wouldn't be   to take
  

00:08:43.310   00:08:45.130  
structure you wouldn't be   to take
the     it  

00:08:45.130   00:08:45.140  
the   formless potential and give it
  

00:08:45.140   00:08:47.230  
the   formless potential and give it
structure     something  

00:08:47.230   00:08:47.240  
structure   and I think that's something
  

00:08:47.240   00:08:49.510  
structure   and I think that's something
it's     of  

00:08:49.510   00:08:49.520  
it's a can in some way to the idea of
 

00:08:49.520   00:08:51.370  
it's a can in some way to the idea of
God     and    develop  

00:08:51.370   00:08:51.380  
God the Father and   develop
  

00:08:51.380   00:08:54.160  
God the Father and   develop 
   the  

00:08:54.160   00:08:54.170  
   the
  

00:08:54.170   00:08:55.420  
   the
notion     that     something  

00:08:55.420   00:08:55.430  
notion   there's something
  

00:08:55.430   00:08:58.150  
notion   there's something
in     us  

00:08:58.150   00:08:58.160  
in all   of us that transcends all of us
  

00:08:58.160   00:09:00.130  
in all   of us that transcends all of us 
   of  

00:09:00.130   00:09:00.140  
  that's deeply structural that's part of
  

00:09:00.140   00:09:01.720  
  that's deeply structural that's part of 
   say  

00:09:01.720   00:09:01.730  
   while I would say
  

00:09:01.730   00:09:04.290  
   while I would say
evolutionary     that  

00:09:04.290   00:09:04.300  
evolutionary and cultural process that
 

00:09:04.300   00:09:07.270  
evolutionary and cultural process that
enables   formless  

00:09:07.270   00:09:07.280  
enables   with the formless
  

00:09:07.280   00:09:09.610  
enables   with the formless
potential     reality  

00:09:09.610   00:09:09.620  
potential and bring forth reality
 

00:09:09.620   00:09:12.010  
potential and bring forth reality
   the  

00:09:12.010   00:09:12.020  
  roughly speaking and then there's the
  

00:09:12.020   00:09:13.900  
  roughly speaking and then there's the
final     to  

00:09:13.900   00:09:13.910  
final   element and that element seems to
  

00:09:13.910   00:09:16.150  
final   element and that element seems to
be     itself  

00:09:16.150   00:09:16.160  
be   something like consciousness itself
  

00:09:16.160   00:09:17.740  
be   something like consciousness itself
the     in  

00:09:17.740   00:09:17.750  
the consciousness that   actually in
  

00:09:17.750   00:09:19.900  
the consciousness that   actually in 
   not  

00:09:19.900   00:09:19.910  
  here's in the individual so it's not
  

00:09:19.910   00:09:22.000  
  here's in the individual so it's not
only     you     that  

00:09:22.000   00:09:22.010  
only that   have a structure it's that
  

00:09:22.010   00:09:23.980  
only that   have a structure it's that
the     for  

00:09:23.980   00:09:23.990  
the structure has   the capacity for
  

00:09:23.990   00:09:27.430  
the structure has   the capacity for
action     world     it's  

00:09:27.430   00:09:27.440  
action   and it's like it's
  

00:09:27.440   00:09:29.500  
action   and it's like it's 
   the

   the

   the
dead     it's     like

dead structure life it's   something like
  

00:09:31.520   00:09:33.550  
dead structure life it's   something like

  of fundamentally defining belief so all

  of fundamentally defining belief so all 
   ideas  

00:13:37.270   00:13:37.280  
  right so so that's the sort of ideas
  

00:13:37.280   00:13:39.460  
  right so so that's the sort of ideas
that     tradition  

00:13:39.460   00:13:39.470  
that there's this this   god of tradition

that there's this this   god of tradition

   and and primarily
something     also  

00:13:49.360   00:13:49.370  
something that's verbal which I also
 

00:13:49.370   00:13:50.980  
something that's verbal which I also
   because  

00:13:50.980   00:13:50.990  
  think is extremely interesting because
  

00:13:50.990   00:13:52.420  
  think is extremely interesting because 
   thought  

00:13:52.420   00:13:52.430  
   associated not with thought
  

00:13:52.430   00:13:54.880  
   associated not with thought
precisely     think  

00:13:54.880   00:13:54.890  
precisely but with speech   and I think
  

00:13:54.890   00:13:57.430  
precisely but with speech   and I think
the     there's  

00:13:57.430   00:13:57.440  
the reason   for that is is that there's
  

00:13:57.440   00:13:59.200  
the reason   for that is is that there's
something     than  

00:13:59.200   00:13:59.210  
something   to speech that's more than
  

00:13:59.210   00:14:01.090  
something   to speech that's more than
mere     the  

00:14:01.090   00:14:01.100  
mere thought and I think part of the
 

00:14:01.100   00:14:02.500  
mere thought and I think part of the
reason   a  

00:14:02.500   00:14:02.510  
reason   for that is that speech is a
  

00:14:02.510   00:14:05.020  
reason   for that is that speech is a
public     utterance     in  

00:14:05.020   00:14:05.030  
public utterance   and at least in
  

00:14:05.030   00:14:06.970  
public utterance   and at least in 
   that's  

00:14:06.970   00:14:06.980  
   that's
  

00:14:06.980   00:14:09.580  
   that's
shaped     everywhere  

00:14:09.580   00:14:09.590  
shaped by the existence of of everywhere
 

00:14:09.590   00:14:11.890  
shaped by the existence of of everywhere
   time  

00:14:11.890   00:14:11.900  
  of everyone else at least across time
  

00:14:11.900   00:14:14.860  
  of everyone else at least across time
because     speeches  

00:14:14.860   00:14:14.870  
because when you speak you your speeches
 

00:14:14.870   00:14:18.070  
because when you speak you your speeches
is   causal  

00:14:18.070   00:14:18.080

they want to   and then to
trace     ideas     see  

00:18:43.230   00:18:43.240  
trace it back to   to see
  

00:18:43.240   00:18:44.730

and   of course I don't speak the original
languages     had     secondary

   the deep idea
you     this  

00:19:51.960   00:19:51.970  
you see that's associated with this
 

00:19:51.970   00:19:55.380  
you see that's associated with this
notion     endless    for  

00:19:55.380   00:19:55.390  
notion of endless   so for
  

00:19:55.390   00:19:56.920  
notion of endless   so for
example     are  

00:19:56.920   00:19:56.930  
example the words that   are
  

00:19:56.930   00:19:59.320  
example the words that   are 
   void  

00:19:59.320   00:19:59.330  
   without form and void
  

00:19:59.330   00:20:02.680  
   without form and void 
   I'm  

00:20:02.680   00:20:02.690  
   like well one is toll I'm

it's     because  

00:20:08.710   00:20:08.720  
  it's important to know this because

  and i think
  

00:22:10.419   00:22:13.169  
  and i think
see    brains  

00:22:13.169   00:22:13.179  
see   I think also that the way our brains
  

00:22:13.179   00:22:14.639  
see   I think also that the way our brains
are     and     something  

00:22:14.639   00:22:14.649  
are structured and   this is something
  

00:22:14.649   00:22:15.899  
are structured and   this is something
that     try     more

that   to develop more
  

00:22:15.909   00:22:18.299  
that   to develop more
today     that  

00:22:18.299   00:22:18.309  
  today is that the ancient circuits that

that     territory  

00:22:28.200   00:22:28.210  
  that so that's that unknown territory
  

00:22:28.210   00:22:31.019

that's     promise

of     ago    we  

00:22:38.970   00:22:38.980  
of years ago   we
  

00:22:38.980   00:22:41.159  
of years ago   we
had     things  

00:22:41.159   00:22:41.169  
had   to go out there and encounter things
  

00:22:41.169   00:22:43.289  
had   to go out there and encounter things 
   there  

00:22:43.289   00:22:43.299  
   and there
  

00:22:43.299   00:22:45.479  
   and there
was     courage  

00:22:45.479   00:22:45.489  
was a kind   of let's say paternal courage
  

00:22:45.489   00:22:47.519  
was a kind   of let's say paternal courage
that     with     was

that went along   and it was
  

00:22:47.529   00:22:50.039  
that went along   and it was
that     that  

00:22:50.039   00:22:50.049  
that   the spirit of paternal courage that
  

00:22:50.049   00:22:52.080  
that   the spirit of paternal courage that
enabled     of     unknown

enabled the conquering of   the unknown

geographical unknowns it's the same
circuit     it 

00:23:45.509   00:23:45.519  
circuit it's just that we do it
 

00:23:45.519   00:23:47.609  
circuit it's just that we do it
abstractly     but 

00:23:47.609   00:23:47.619  
abstractly now instead of concretely but

of course it   to be the same circuit
because     a

very   conservative force and what else
  

00:23:53.799   00:23:56.129  
very   conservative force and what else
would     it     think  

00:23:56.129   00:23:56.139

what constituted evil   really in this 
   of

psychology and   he's thinking well there
  

00:26:26.260   00:26:29.460  
psychology and   he's thinking well there
are     ways     reprehensibly

are various   reprehensibly
  

00:26:29.470   00:26:32.280  
are various   reprehensibly
but     reprehensible

   ebay which I think was a
kind     miracle     have  

00:27:13.119   00:27:13.129  
kind of miracle   because what should have
  

00:27:13.129   00:27:14.769  
kind of miracle   because what should have
happened    me  

00:27:14.769   00:27:14.779  
happened   was that you sent me
  

00:27:14.779   00:27:17.259  
happened   was that you sent me 
   bounced  

00:27:17.259   00:27:17.269  
  junk and I sent you a check that bounced
  

00:27:17.269   00:27:20.159  
  junk and I sent you a check that bounced 
   but  

00:27:20.159   00:27:20.169  
  right and that was the end of eBay but
  

00:27:20.169   00:27:22.749  
  right and that was the end of eBay but
right    what  

00:27:22.749   00:27:22.759  
right   but that isn't what
  

00:27:22.759   00:27:25.019  
right   but that isn't what
happened     default

   exactly but you could pay 
   would

guarantee   the transaction so you know
you     I'd

you wouldn't   send me junk and I'd

you wouldn't   send me junk and I'd 
   pay  

00:27:41.139   00:27:41.149  
   and we'd pay
  

00:27:41.149   00:27:42.789  
   and we'd pay 
   that  

00:27:42.789   00:27:42.799  
  10 percent for someone to guarantee that
  

00:27:42.799   00:27:45.399  
  10 percent for someone to guarantee that
the     default     that

the default   that
  

00:27:45.409   00:27:48.759  
the default   that
those     things     so  

00:27:48.759   00:27:48.769  
those things   vanished right away and so
  

00:27:48.769   00:27:50.830  
those things   vanished right away and so 
   capital  

00:27:50.830   00:27:50.840  
  that meant that all this frozen capital
  

00:27:50.840   00:27:52.509  
  that meant that all this frozen capital
roughly     junk  

00:27:52.509   00:27:52.519  
roughly speaking   which were all the junk
  

00:27:52.519   00:27:53.649  
roughly speaking   which were all the junk 
   that  

00:27:53.649   00:27:53.659  
   lying around that
  

00:27:53.659   00:27:55.779  
   lying around that
someone     became  

00:27:55.779   00:27:55.789  
someone else might want instantly   became
  

00:27:55.789   00:27:57.279  
someone else might want instantly   became
money     reason     worked  

00:27:57.279   00:27:57.289  
money and the only reason   that worked
  

00:27:57.289   00:27:58.659  
money and the only reason   that worked
was     people     another  

00:27:58.659   00:27:58.669  
was   trusted one another
  

00:27:58.669   00:28:02.039  
was   trusted one another 
   powerful  

00:28:02.039   00:28:02.049  
  and so Trust is an unbelievably powerful
  

00:28:02.049   00:28:04.389  
  and so Trust is an unbelievably powerful 
   powerful  

00:28:04.389   00:28:04.399  
   the most powerful
  

00:28:04.399   00:28:07.629  
   the most powerful 
   a

   if you have a
  

00:28:07.639   00:28:08.830  
   if you have a 
   it's  

00:28:08.830   00:28:08.840  
   it's
  

00:28:08.840   00:28:10.869  
   it's
predicated     the  

00:28:10.869   00:28:10.879  
predicated on trust   and part of the
  

00:28:10.879   00:28:13.269  
predicated on trust   and part of the
reason    what  

00:28:13.269   00:28:13.279  
reason   for that is that Trust is what
  

00:28:13.279   00:28:15.009  
reason   for that is that Trust is what
enables     to     without

that for example   and there's endless 
   well

   that and I would say well
this     of     thinking

this is also a good way of   thinking
  

00:34:25.450   00:34:27.359  
this is also a good way of   thinking
about     of

about fiction because a good work of

sense it never happened   it's like well
  

00:34:37.899   00:34:40.290  
sense it never happened   it's like well
it     on     happened

it depends on   mean by happened

it depends on   mean by happened 
   that  

00:34:43.050   00:34:43.060  
  you know it's a it's a pattern that

  you know it's a it's a pattern that
repeats     with

your faith in being but   it shakes it

so     being  

00:43:17.740   00:43:17.750  
so badly that   you turn against being
  

00:43:17.750   00:43:19.720  
so badly that   you turn against being
itself     solution  

00:43:19.720   00:43:19.730  
itself that's certainly no solution
 

00:43:19.730   00:43:20.980  
itself that's certainly no solution
that's     make 

00:43:20.980   00:43:20.990  
that's for sure all it does is make
 

00:43:20.990   00:43:23.260  
that's for sure all it does is make
everything   worse  

00:43:23.260   00:43:23.270  
everything   that's bad even worse
  

00:43:23.270   00:43:29.440  
everything   that's bad even worse
so    be  

00:43:29.440   00:43:29.450  
so   so and God said let there be
  

00:43:29.450   00:43:31.270  
so   so and God said let there be
light     there     saw  

00:43:31.270   00:43:31.280  
   was light and God saw
  

00:43:31.280   00:43:32.490  
   was light and God saw
that     God  

00:43:32.490   00:43:32.500  
that the light   was good and God

   darkness  

00:43:34.630   00:43:34.640  
  separated the light from the darkness
  

00:43:34.640   00:43:37.000  
  separated the light from the darkness 
   that's  

00:43:37.000   00:43:37.010  
   so that's that's another that's
  

00:43:37.010   00:43:38.980  
   so that's that's another that's
another     right  

00:43:38.980   00:43:38.990  
another fundamental separation right
 

00:43:38.990   00:43:40.900  
another fundamental separation right
light     those    are

light and darkness those are those   are
  

00:43:40.910   00:43:43.450  
light and darkness those are those   are
in     sense     of

in some sense   the two fundamental two of

00:43:52.450   00:43:52.460  
it's night well then we're asleep   and so
  

00:43:52.460   00:43:55.840  
it's night well then we're asleep   and so
our     light     and  

00:43:55.840   00:43:55.850  
our existence is bounded by light   and
  

00:43:55.850   00:43:58.090  
our existence is bounded by light   and
darkness    it's  

00:43:58.090   00:43:58.100  
darkness   we're up and alert when it's
  

00:43:58.100   00:44:00.040  
darkness   we're up and alert when it's
light     partly     we're  

00:44:00.040   00:44:00.050  
light and that's partly   because we're
  

00:44:00.050   00:44:02.530  
light and that's partly   because we're
highly     visual     most  

00:44:02.530   00:44:02.540  
highly visual   animals right unlike most
  

00:44:02.540   00:44:04.420  
highly visual   animals right unlike most
animals     smell  

00:44:04.420   00:44:04.430  
animals because most animals you smell
 

00:44:04.430   00:44:06.790  
animals because most animals you smell
we     that 

00:44:06.790   00:44:06.800  
we we use vision we're very strange that
 

00:44:06.800   00:44:08.920  
we we use vision we're very strange that
way   with  

00:44:08.920   00:44:08.930  
way   and vision is associated with
  

00:44:08.930   00:44:10.840  
way   and vision is associated with 
   with  

00:44:10.840   00:44:10.850  
  enlightenment and illumination and with
  

00:44:10.850   00:44:12.790  
  enlightenment and illumination and with
the     coming  

00:44:12.790   00:44:12.800  
the breaking of   the dawn with the coming
  

00:44:12.800   00:44:15.670  
the breaking of   the dawn with the coming
of    so  

00:44:15.670   00:44:15.680  
of   so
  

00:44:15.680   00:44:19.570  
of   so
for     in  

00:44:19.570   00:44:19.580  
for light to be created is associated in
 

00:44:19.580   00:44:21.130  
for light to be created is associated in
   of  

00:44:21.130   00:44:21.140  
  some sense with the emergence of
  

00:44:21.140   00:44:22.690  
  some sense with the emergence of
conscious     another  

00:44:22.690   00:44:22.700  
conscious being and so that's another
 

00:44:22.700   00:44:25.900  
conscious being and so that's another
echo     notion    the  

00:44:25.900   00:44:25.910  
echo of that notion   they're the the
  

00:44:25.910   00:44:28.930  
echo of that notion   they're the the 
   story  

00:44:28.930   00:44:28.940  
  particular phrasing of the of the story
  

00:44:28.940   00:44:31.180  
  particular phrasing of the of the story 
   again  

00:44:31.180   00:44:31.190  
  also is important because it's again
  

00:44:31.190   00:44:33.160  
  also is important because it's again 
   of  

00:44:33.160   00:44:33.170  
   fed right so that's the use of
  

00:44:33.170   00:44:36.160  
   fed right so that's the use of 
   element  

00:44:36.160   00:44:36.170  
   the active element
  

00:44:36.170   00:44:39.790  
   the active element
of     the     the  

00:44:39.790   00:44:39.800  
of the   rise to the
  

00:44:39.800   00:44:41.710  
of the   rise to the
gives     chaos     like  

00:44:41.710   00:44:41.720  
gives order to chaos   it's something like
  

00:44:41.720   00:44:44.170  
gives order to chaos   it's something like
that     it's     the  

00:44:44.170   00:44:44.180  
that so it's   the spirit of the
  

00:44:44.180   00:44:47.770  
that so it's   the spirit of the
structure     produces  

00:44:47.770   00:44:47.780  
structure manifests itself and produces
 

00:44:47.780   00:44:50.290  
structure manifests itself and produces
the     experience 

00:44:50.290   00:44:50.300  
the fundamental divisions of experience
 

00:44:50.300   00:44:52.560  
the fundamental divisions of experience
that's     what's    and  

00:44:52.560   00:44:52.570  
that's what's   here and
  

00:44:52.570   00:44:54.700  
that's what's   here and
God     the     the  

00:44:54.700   00:44:54.710  
God separated the   light from the
  

00:44:54.710   00:44:56.560  
God separated the   light from the
darkness     the  

00:44:56.560   00:44:56.570  
darkness   he called the light day and the
  

00:44:56.570   00:44:58.720  
darkness   he called the light day and the
darkness     he     again  

00:44:58.720   00:44:58.730  
darkness he   called night and again again
  

00:44:58.730   00:45:00.730  
darkness he   called night and again again 
   also  

00:45:00.730   00:45:00.740  
  the fact that things are named is also
  

00:45:00.740   00:45:02.920  
  the fact that things are named is also
very     important     later  

00:45:02.920   00:45:02.930  
very important   so you see this later
  

00:45:02.930   00:45:05.020  
very important   so you see this later
with     because     job  

00:45:05.020   00:45:05.030  
   God gives Adam the job
  

00:45:05.030   00:45:06.640  
   God gives Adam the job
of    sort  

00:45:06.640   00:45:06.650  
of   animals and it's sort
  

00:45:06.650   00:45:07.990  
of   animals and it's sort
of     exist  

00:45:07.990   00:45:08.000  
of   like the animals don't actually exist
  

00:45:08.000   00:45:10.349  
of   like the animals don't actually exist
in     sense     and  

00:45:10.349   00:45:10.359  
   and
  

00:45:10.359   00:45:13.630  
   and
that's     of     the  

00:45:13.630   00:45:13.640  
that's that's another indication of   the
  

00:45:13.640   00:45:16.570  
that's that's another indication of   the
authors     of     come  

00:45:16.570   00:45:16.580  
authors of   the Bible's attempt to come
  

00:45:16.580   00:45:17.890  
authors of   the Bible's attempt to come
to     fact     our  

00:45:17.890   00:45:17.900  
to terms with the fact   that our
  

00:45:17.900   00:45:19.930  
to terms with the fact   that our 
   to  

00:45:19.930   00:45:19.940  
   and our ability to
  

00:45:19.940   00:45:22.540  
   and our ability to 
   way  

00:45:22.540   00:45:22.550  
   have something to do with the way
  

00:45:22.550   00:45:24.820  
   have something to do with the way 
   into  

00:45:24.820   00:45:24.830  
   chaotic potential into
  

00:45:24.830   00:45:27.099  
   chaotic potential into
actuality    we  

00:45:27.099   00:45:27.109  
actuality   we can't we
  

00:45:27.109   00:45:28.599  
actuality   we can't we
can't     get     something  

00:45:28.599   00:45:28.609  
can't really get   on something
  

00:45:28.609   00:45:30.460  
can't really get   on something 
   is  

00:45:30.460   00:45:30.470  
   is
  

00:45:30.470   00:45:32.590  
   is
like     for     and  

00:45:32.590   00:45:32.600  
   example you all have names and
  

00:45:32.600   00:45:34.120  
   example you all have names and
everything     to  

00:45:34.120   00:45:34.130  
everything   that you encounter has to
  

00:45:34.130   00:45:36.190  
everything   that you encounter has to
have     name  

00:45:36.190   00:45:36.200  
have a name because before it has a   name
  

00:45:36.200   00:45:37.060  
have a name because before it has a   name
it's    of  

00:45:37.060   00:45:37.070  
it's   just kind of
  

00:45:37.070   00:45:38.740  
it's   just kind of
part     of     in  

00:45:38.740   00:45:38.750  
part of   the blurry background in
  

00:45:38.750   00:45:40.570  
part of   the blurry background in
something     it  

00:45:40.570   00:45:40.580  
something like   that and you could say it
  

00:45:40.580   00:45:42.670  
something like   that and you could say it
exists    and  

00:45:42.670   00:45:42.680  
exists   and
  

00:45:42.680   00:45:44.770  
exists   and
that's     it  

00:45:44.770   00:45:44.780  
that's true but it's also true   that it
  

00:45:44.780   00:45:46.750  
that's true but it's also true   that it
doesn't     name  

00:45:46.750   00:45:46.760  
doesn't exist   before it has a name
  

00:45:46.760   00:45:48.640  
doesn't exist   before it has a name 
   a  

00:45:48.640   00:45:48.650  
   something a
  

00:45:48.650   00:45:50.860  
   something a
name     you've  

00:45:50.860   00:45:50.870  
name its nature changes and you've
 

00:45:50.870   00:45:53.140  
name its nature changes and you've
   not  

00:45:53.140   00:45:53.150  
   not
  

00:45:53.150   00:45:55.840  
   not
so     much     it's  

00:45:55.840   00:45:55.850  
so much   mere potential anymore but it's
  

00:45:55.850   00:45:58.030  
so much   mere potential anymore but it's
at     on     actuality  

00:45:58.030   00:45:58.040  
at least   its way to being actuality
  

00:45:58.040   00:46:00.250  
at least   its way to being actuality
it's     to     so  

00:46:00.250   00:46:00.260  
it's on its way   being a tool and so
  

00:46:00.260   00:46:03.070  
it's on its way   being a tool and so
the     repeated  

00:46:03.070   00:46:03.080  
the act of naming   is repeated
  

00:46:03.080   00:46:05.590  
the act of naming   is repeated
continually     the  

00:46:05.590   00:46:05.600  
continually in the   first chapters of the
  

00:46:05.600   00:46:07.210  
continually in the   first chapters of the 
   this  

00:46:07.210   00:46:07.220  
  Bible and the reason for that is this
  

00:46:07.220   00:46:09.540  
  Bible and the reason for that is this
continued     emphasis     of  

00:46:09.540   00:46:09.550  
continued emphasis   on the importance of
  

00:46:09.550   00:46:12.010  
continued emphasis   on the importance of
consciousness     articulation  

00:46:12.010   00:46:12.020  
consciousness and conscious articulation
 

00:46:12.020   00:46:14.290  
consciousness and conscious articulation
and     speech    is  

00:46:14.290   00:46:14.300  
and speech   you know when speech is
  

00:46:14.300   00:46:16.360  
and speech   you know when speech is 
   us  

00:46:16.360   00:46:16.370  
   does separate us
  

00:46:16.370   00:46:18.430  
   does separate us
in     important     you  

00:46:18.430   00:46:18.440  
in an important   you
  

00:46:18.440   00:46:20.950  
in an important   you
know     far  

00:46:20.950   00:46:20.960  
know like we haven't got very   far
  

00:46:20.960   00:46:23.560  
know like we haven't got very   far
teaching     best  

00:46:23.560   00:46:23.570  
  teaching animals how to speak the best
  

00:46:23.570   00:46:25.900  
  teaching animals how to speak the best
we've     so     parrots  

00:46:25.900   00:46:25.910  
we've managed so   far as some parrots
  

00:46:25.910   00:46:27.970  
we've managed so   far as some parrots 
   there  

00:46:27.970   00:46:27.980  
  right there's gray African parrot there
  

00:46:27.980   00:46:29.380  
  right there's gray African parrot there 
   a  

00:46:29.380   00:46:29.390  
  is one of them that got up to about a
  

00:46:29.390   00:46:31.060  
  is one of them that got up to about a 
   that's  

00:46:31.060   00:46:31.070  
   level and that's
  

00:46:31.070   00:46:32.860  
   level and that's
mind-boggling     is  

00:46:32.860   00:46:32.870  
mind-boggling   because like how big is
  

00:46:32.870   00:46:35.470  
mind-boggling   because like how big is
the     brain     big  

00:46:35.470   00:46:35.480  
the brain   of a parrot it's like that big
  

00:46:35.480   00:46:37.690  
the brain   of a parrot it's like that big
and    so  

00:46:37.690   00:46:37.700  
and   that bloody thing could talk and so
  

00:46:37.700   00:46:38.890  
and   that bloody thing could talk and so
that     shows     about  

00:46:38.890   00:46:38.900  
that shows   we know about
  

00:46:38.900   00:46:41.500  
that shows   we know about
brains     all  

00:46:41.500   00:46:41.510  
brains   but I know they're small and all
  

00:46:41.510   00:46:43.360  
brains   but I know they're small and all
that     teaching  

00:46:43.360   00:46:43.370  
that but and we tried teaching
 

00:46:43.370   00:46:45.280  
that but and we tried teaching
chimpanzees     kind 

00:46:45.280   00:46:45.290  
chimpanzees to talk and they could kind
 

00:46:45.290   00:46:46.600  
chimpanzees to talk and they could kind
   language  

00:46:46.600   00:46:46.610  
  of get somewhere with sign language
  

00:46:46.610   00:46:48.280  
  of get somewhere with sign language 
   were  

00:46:48.280   00:46:48.290  
  especially if you started when they were
  

00:46:48.290   00:46:50.500  
  especially if you started when they were
young     capacity  

00:46:50.500   00:46:50.510  
young but   they don't have the capacity
  

00:46:50.510   00:46:52.300

then   don't have to do anything it's
a     lack     of

and   there was morning the second day
well     how  

00:53:03.829   00:53:03.839  
well to understand that because   what how
  

00:53:03.839   00:53:05.900  
well to understand that because   what how 
   all  

00:53:05.900   00:53:05.910  
   at all
  

00:53:05.910   00:53:08.630  
   at all
really     I     little  

00:53:08.630   00:53:08.640  
really so I   little
  

00:53:08.640   00:53:11.450  
really so I   little
bit     about     the  

00:53:11.450   00:53:11.460  
   this before so the the the
  

00:53:11.460   00:53:12.890  
   this before so the the the
world     created     this  

00:53:12.890   00:53:12.900  
world   in this
  

00:53:12.900   00:53:14.450  
world   in this
particular    phenomenological  

00:53:14.450   00:53:14.460  
particular   account is a phenomenological
  

00:53:14.460   00:53:17.480  
particular   account is a phenomenological
world     if  

00:53:17.480   00:53:17.490  
world there's a   disc of land because if
  

00:53:17.490   00:53:18.680  
world there's a   disc of land because if
you     out     around  

00:53:18.680   00:53:18.690  
you go   and look around
  

00:53:18.690   00:53:20.450  
you go   and look around
you're     a     pretty  

00:53:20.450   00:53:20.460  
   that's pretty
  

00:53:20.460   00:53:21.799  
   that's pretty
obvious    top  

00:53:21.799   00:53:21.809  
obvious   and then there's a dome on top
  

00:53:21.809   00:53:23.390  
obvious   and then there's a dome on top
of     it's     the  

00:53:23.390   00:53:23.400  
   more or less held up by the
  

00:53:23.400   00:53:25.520  
   more or less held up by the
mountains     down     there's  

00:53:25.520   00:53:25.530  
mountains and rain comes down   so there's
  

00:53:25.530   00:53:27.380  
mountains and rain comes down   so there's
water     the     else  

00:53:27.380   00:53:27.390  
water above   where else
  

00:53:27.390   00:53:29.599  
water above   where else 
   underneath  

00:53:29.599   00:53:29.609  
   and underneath
  

00:53:29.609   00:53:31.880  
   and underneath
the     ground     can  

00:53:31.880   00:53:31.890  
the ground   you can
  

00:53:31.890   00:53:33.260  
the ground   you can
drill     down     around  

00:53:33.260   00:53:33.270  
drill down   out and then around
  

00:53:33.270   00:53:35.210  
drill down   out and then around
out     the  

00:53:35.210   00:53:35.220  
out there's salt water and so that's the
 

00:53:35.220   00:53:37.130  
out there's salt water and so that's the
   empirical  

00:53:37.130   00:53:37.140  
  world and it's kind of an empirical
  

00:53:37.140   00:53:39.260  
  world and it's kind of an empirical
world     you  

00:53:39.260   00:53:39.270  
world because if you're a child and   you
  

00:53:39.270   00:53:40.760  
world because if you're a child and   you 
   at  

00:53:40.760   00:53:40.770  
   go out in the field and you look at
  

00:53:40.770   00:53:42.200  
   go out in the field and you look at
the     it     would  

00:53:42.200   00:53:42.210  
the world that's sort of what it   would
  

00:53:42.210   00:53:44.480  
the world that's sort of what it   would
be     like     that's  

00:53:44.480   00:53:44.490  
   that's
  

00:53:44.490   00:53:46.609  
   that's
being    things  

00:53:46.609   00:53:46.619  
being   and so one of the things
  

00:53:46.619   00:53:48.829  
being   and so one of the things
that     thinking     is  

00:53:48.829   00:53:48.839  
that is worth thinking   this is
  

00:53:48.839   00:53:50.420  
that is worth thinking   this is
something     interested  

00:53:50.420   00:53:50.430  
something Carl Jung was very interested
 

00:53:50.430   00:53:54.530  
something Carl Jung was very interested
in     that    are  

00:53:54.530   00:53:54.540  
in is that   these old descriptions are
  

00:53:54.540   00:53:57.980  
in is that   these old descriptions are
half     so  

00:53:57.980   00:53:57.990  
half geographical and half empirical so
 

00:53:57.990   00:54:00.170  
half geographical and half empirical so
sort     and    half  

00:54:00.170   00:54:00.180  
sort of based on observation and   half
  

00:54:00.180   00:54:01.339  
sort of based on observation and   half
psychological 

00:54:01.339   00:54:01.349  
psychological
 

00:54:01.349   00:54:02.839  
psychological
so     of    was  

00:54:02.839   00:54:02.849  
so one of   was
  

00:54:02.849   00:54:04.940  
so one of   was
interested     astrology  

00:54:04.940   00:54:04.950  
interested   in for example was astrology
  

00:54:04.950   00:54:06.680  
interested   in for example was astrology
but     reason  

00:54:06.680   00:54:06.690  
but mostly for   a psychological reason
  

00:54:06.690   00:54:08.809  
but mostly for   a psychological reason
because    there  

00:54:08.809   00:54:08.819  
   obviously there
  

00:54:08.819   00:54:11.420  
   obviously there
are     when  

00:54:11.420   00:54:11.430  
are stars up on the dome and then when
 

00:54:11.430   00:54:13.270  
are stars up on the dome and then when
you     look    imagine  

00:54:13.270   00:54:13.280  
you look   can imagine
  

00:54:13.280   00:54:16.010  
you look   can imagine 
   helps  

00:54:16.010   00:54:16.020  
   that helps
  

00:54:16.020   00:54:17.720  
   that helps
you     yourself     as  

00:54:17.720   00:54:17.730  
you orient yourself   as
  

00:54:17.730   00:54:19.339  
you orient yourself   as
you     then  

00:54:19.339   00:54:19.349  
you can see shapes and the   stars then
  

00:54:19.349   00:54:21.620  
you can see shapes and the   stars then
you     and  

00:54:21.620   00:54:21.630  
you can recognize   the constellations and
  

00:54:21.630   00:54:23.660  
you can recognize   the constellations and
you     but  

00:54:23.660   00:54:23.670  
you can orient yourself at night   but
  

00:54:23.670   00:54:25.609  
you can orient yourself at night   but
then     become     say  

00:54:25.609   00:54:25.619  
then the constellations become   God's say
  

00:54:25.619   00:54:28.099  
then the constellations become   God's say
and     turn     so  

00:54:28.099   00:54:28.109  
and the gods   and so
  

00:54:28.109   00:54:30.180  
and the gods   and so
and     from  

00:54:30.180   00:54:30.190  
and the drama comes from
 

00:54:30.190   00:54:32.400  
and the drama comes from
   imagination  

00:54:32.400   00:54:32.410  
  then it's the projection of imagination
  

00:54:32.410   00:54:33.980  
  then it's the projection of imagination
and     was     analyzing  

00:54:33.980   00:54:33.990  
and so when   analyzing
  

00:54:33.990   00:54:37.130  
and so when   analyzing
astrology     analyzing  

00:54:37.130   00:54:37.140  
  astrology he was in that analyzing
  

00:54:37.140   00:54:39.780  
  astrology he was in that analyzing
psychology     the  

00:54:39.780   00:54:39.790  
psychology because he saw   the
  

00:54:39.790   00:54:43.590  
psychology because he saw   the
astrological     projection  

00:54:43.590   00:54:43.600  
astrological   narrative as the projection
  

00:54:43.600   00:54:45.660  
astrological   narrative as the projection
of     human     cosmos  

00:54:45.660   00:54:45.670  
of the human   onto the cosmos
  

00:54:45.670   00:54:47.460  
of the human   onto the cosmos
and     astrology  

00:54:47.460   00:54:47.470  
and   so when he was analyzing astrology
  

00:54:47.470   00:54:49.470  
and   so when he was analyzing astrology
who     and     that  

00:54:49.470   00:54:49.480  
who was analyzing psychology and   that
  

00:54:49.480   00:54:50.850  
who was analyzing psychology and   that
the     same     these  

00:54:50.850   00:54:50.860

structure   is out there and you know he's
pretty     is  

00:56:23.550   00:56:23.560  
pretty smart because   most of them is
  

00:56:23.560   00:56:25.410  
pretty smart because   most of them is
still     say  

00:56:25.410   00:56:25.420  
  still where it's safe and I would say
  

00:56:25.420   00:56:27.060  
  still where it's safe and I would say
that's     thing  

00:56:27.060   00:56:27.070  
that's a good that's a good   thing
  

00:56:27.070   00:56:28.800  
that's a good that's a good   thing
because     right     well  

00:56:28.800   00:56:28.810  
because   out there well
  

00:56:28.810   00:56:30.630  
because   out there well
then     of     the  

00:56:30.630   00:56:30.640  
then maybe you fall off the   the

then maybe you fall off the   the

actually a neuro physiological signal
 

00:59:20.230   00:59:22.260  
actually a neuro physiological signal
that     of    cosmos  

00:59:22.260   00:59:22.270  
that you've got the forces of   cosmos

   you know our brain is

that   a real signal

that   a real signal
and     reduce     well  

00:59:44.310   00:59:44.320  
and you can reduce   it you could say well
  

00:59:44.320   00:59:47.160  
and you can reduce   it you could say well
the     know

the problem   with being where you know

the problem   with being where you know
only    everything  

00:59:49.950   00:59:49.960  
only   is that you don't know everything

only   is that you don't know everything 
   the

   that's going to be a problem in the

and   you can't handle it so you've got to
  

01:00:02.710   01:00:04.200  
and   you can't handle it so you've got to
mediate     between     you

if you read the writings   of people like
the     up     Columbine  

01:04:56.200   01:04:56.210  
the kids who showed up   the Columbine
  

01:04:56.210   01:04:57.790  
the kids who showed up   the Columbine
High     tell     exactly  

01:04:57.790   01:04:57.800  
High School   you exactly
  

01:04:57.800   01:05:00.550  
High School   you exactly 
   what  

01:05:00.550   01:05:00.560  
  that that's precisely and exactly what
  

01:05:00.560   01:05:02.620  
  that that's precisely and exactly what
they     out  

01:05:02.620   01:05:02.630  
they   conclude it and then act it out
  

01:05:02.630   01:05:05.140  
they   conclude it and then act it out
so     this     it  

01:05:05.140   01:05:05.150  
so anyways but in this   God says that it
  

01:05:05.150   01:05:07.060  
so anyways but in this   God says that it
was     and     lot  

01:05:07.060   01:05:07.070  
was good and   lot
  

01:05:07.070   01:05:08.530  
was good and   lot
is    is  

01:05:08.530   01:05:08.540  
is   like because the question is
  

01:05:08.540   01:05:10.030  
is   like because the question is
something    something  

01:05:10.030   01:05:10.040  
something   like well is it something
  

01:05:10.040   01:05:13.000  
something   like well is it something 
   a  

01:05:13.000   01:05:13.010  
  better than nothing because that's a
  

01:05:13.010   01:05:15.130  
  better than nothing because that's a
really     question     I  

01:05:15.130   01:05:15.140  
   and I
  

01:05:15.140   01:05:17.230  
   and I
thought     relationship  

01:05:17.230   01:05:17.240  
thought about two   things in relationship
  

01:05:17.240   01:05:20.470  
thought about two   things in relationship
to     it  

01:05:20.470   01:05:20.480  
to that   and one is one is well maybe it
  

01:05:20.480   01:05:23.020  
to that   and one is one is well maybe it 
   right  

01:05:23.020   01:05:23.030  
   are right
  

01:05:23.030   01:05:25.390  
   are right 
   ways  

01:05:25.390   01:05:25.400  
   are ways
  

01:05:25.400   01:05:27.370  
   are ways
of     being     the  

01:05:27.370   01:05:27.380  
of being   the
  

01:05:27.380   01:05:29.560  
of being   the
world    the  

01:05:29.560   01:05:29.570  
world   and their ways of being in the
  

01:05:29.570   01:05:31.120  
world   and their ways of being in the
world     unbearable  

01:05:31.120   01:05:31.130  
world   that makes the world unbearable
  

01:05:31.130   01:05:33.550  
world   that makes the world unbearable
and     believe     that  

01:05:33.550   01:05:33.560  
   that the narrative that
  

01:05:33.560   01:05:35.230  
   that the narrative that
runs     is  

01:05:35.230   01:05:35.240  
runs through the   biblical stories is
  

01:05:35.240   01:05:37.540  
runs through the   biblical stories is
precisely     a     two  

01:05:37.540   01:05:37.550  
precisely a   dialogue between those two
  

01:05:37.550   01:05:39.850  
precisely a   dialogue between those two
types     of     of  

01:05:39.850   01:05:39.860  
types of   and the optimistic part of
  

01:05:39.860   01:05:43.150  
types of   and the optimistic part of
the     requires  

01:05:43.150   01:05:43.160  
the story is that being requires
 

01:05:43.160   01:05:45.100  
the story is that being requires
limitation     suffering    no  

01:05:45.100   01:05:45.110  
limitation and suffering   there's no
  

01:05:45.110   01:05:46.960  
limitation and suffering   there's no
escape     of  

01:05:46.960   01:05:46.970  
escape from   that but there are modes of
  

01:05:46.970   01:05:49.750  
escape from   that but there are modes of
being     even  

01:05:49.750   01:05:49.760  
being that allow that   to be perhaps even
  

01:05:49.760   01:05:51.460  
being that allow that   to be perhaps even
more     are  

01:05:51.460   01:05:51.470  
more   than tolerable perhaps there are
  

01:05:51.470   01:05:52.960  
more   than tolerable perhaps there are 
   be  

01:05:52.960   01:05:52.970  
  modes of being that allow that to be
  

01:05:52.970   01:05:55.720  
  modes of being that allow that to be
good    road  

01:05:55.720   01:05:55.730  
good   road
  

01:05:55.730   01:05:58.330  
good   road
it's     difficult     so  

01:05:58.330   01:05:58.340  
it's a very difficult   road to tread so
  

01:05:58.340   01:06:00.880  
it's a very difficult   road to tread so
so     you  

01:06:00.880   01:06:00.890  
so I think well   that that's possible you
  

01:06:00.890   01:06:03.040  
so I think well   that that's possible you
know     by     and  

01:06:03.040   01:06:03.050  
know I'm not an optimist by   and
  

01:06:03.050   01:06:05.650  
know I'm not an optimist by   and
but     that  

01:06:05.650   01:06:05.660  
but that's that's one of the things that
 

01:06:05.660   01:06:08.260  
but that's that's one of the things that
I've     conceptualized    that  

01:06:08.260   01:06:08.270  
I've conceptualized   and read about that
  

01:06:08.270   01:06:10.150  
I've conceptualized   and read about that
I     it's  

01:06:10.150   01:06:10.160  
I actually find plausible because   it's
  

01:06:10.160   01:06:11.830  
I actually find plausible because   it's
certainly    this  

01:06:11.830   01:06:11.840  
certainly   everyone knows this
  

01:06:11.840   01:06:13.240  
certainly   everyone knows this
that     you     and  

01:06:13.240   01:06:13.250  
that there   can act and
  

01:06:13.250   01:06:14.200  
that there   can act and
make    worse  

01:06:14.200   01:06:14.210  
make   things worse
  

01:06:14.210   01:06:16.870  
make   things worse
everyone     that     the  

01:06:16.870   01:06:16.880  
everyone knows that   so if that's the
  

01:06:16.880   01:06:18.790  
everyone knows that   so if that's the 
   right  

01:06:18.790   01:06:18.800  
  case there has to be the opposite right
  

01:06:18.800   01:06:20.710  
  case there has to be the opposite right
there     that     act  

01:06:20.710   01:06:20.720  
there has to be ways that   you could act
  

01:06:20.720   01:06:23.320  
there has to be ways that   you could act 
   obviously  

01:06:23.320   01:06:23.330  
   better and obviously
  

01:06:23.330   01:06:24.820  
   better and obviously
you     that     things  

01:06:24.820   01:06:24.830  
   things
  

01:06:24.830   01:06:28.540  
   things
really     is  

01:06:28.540   01:06:28.550  
really   way worse and so the question is
  

01:06:28.550   01:06:30.280  
really   way worse and so the question is
well     that     and  

01:06:30.280   01:06:30.290  
well are there   you can act and
  

01:06:30.290   01:06:32.710  
well are there   you can act and 
   I  

01:06:32.710   01:06:32.720  
  make things really much better and I
  

01:06:32.720   01:06:34.780  
  make things really much better and I
think    have  

01:06:34.780   01:06:34.790  
think   that's the question is can we have
  

01:06:34.790   01:06:35.920  
think   that's the question is can we have
our    too  

01:06:35.920   01:06:35.930  
our   cake and eat it too
  

01:06:35.930   01:06:38.110  
our   cake and eat it too
can     requires  

01:06:38.110   01:06:38.120  
can we have the   being that requires
  

01:06:38.120   01:06:40.690  
can we have the   being that requires
limitation     also  

01:06:40.690   01:06:40.700  
limitation and suffering and   also
  

01:06:40.700   01:06:42.790  
limitation and suffering and   also
simultaneously     our  

01:06:42.790   01:06:42.800  
simultaneously transcend that by our
 

01:06:42.800   01:06:44.920  
simultaneously transcend that by our
   the  

01:06:44.920   01:06:44.930  
   of being and I believe that the
  

01:06:44.930   01:06:47.020  
   of being and I believe that the
biblical     perhaps     not  

01:06:47.020   01:06:47.030  
biblical stories and then perhaps   not
  

01:06:47.030   01:06:48.370  
biblical stories and then perhaps   not 
   the  

01:06:48.370   01:06:48.380  
  only the biblical stories but the
  

01:06:48.380   01:06:51.160  
  only the biblical stories but the
biblical     human     imagine  

01:06:51.160   01:06:51.170  
biblical   imagine
  

01:06:51.170   01:06:53.140  
biblical   imagine
one     of     best  

01:06:53.140   01:06:53.150  
one of   the human imaginations best
  

01:06:53.150   01:06:55.660  
one of   the human imaginations best 
   that  

01:06:55.660   01:06:55.670  
   answer that
  

01:06:55.670   01:06:58.120  
   answer that
question    is  

01:06:58.120   01:06:58.130  
question   story is
  

01:06:58.130   01:07:00.130  
question   story is
about     the  

01:07:00.130   01:07:00.140  
about so the first of   it is the
  

01:07:00.140   01:07:02.200  
about so the first of   it is the
catastrophe     of  

01:07:02.200   01:07:02.210  
catastrophe of the collapse of

   the entrance of

   the entrance of
humanity     it  

01:07:06.280   01:07:06.290  
humanity into history   and the rest of it
  

01:07:06.290   01:07:08.800  
humanity into history   and the rest of it
is    know  

01:07:08.800   01:07:08.810  
is   in history now we know
  

01:07:08.810   01:07:10.570  
is   in history now we know
that    about  

01:07:10.570   01:07:10.580  
that   die we know about

being   of acting in the
  

01:07:14.990   01:07:17.860  
being   of acting in the
world    justifiable  

01:07:17.860   01:07:17.870  
world   that allows that to be justifiable
  

01:07:17.870   01:07:19.480  
world   that allows that to be justifiable
or     even     to  

01:07:19.480   01:07:19.490  
or maybe even   more that allows that to
  

01:07:19.490   01:07:22.390  
or maybe even   more that allows that to
be    say  

01:07:22.390   01:07:22.400  
be   would also say
  

01:07:22.400   01:07:25.690  
be   would also say
maybe     know  

01:07:25.690   01:07:25.700  
maybe it's worth finding out you know
 

01:07:25.700   01:07:27.160  
maybe it's worth finding out you know
that     that's    so  

01:07:27.160   01:07:27.170  
that that's   so
  

01:07:27.170   01:07:28.570  
that that's   so 
   this  

01:07:28.570   01:07:28.580  
   because you've got this
  

01:07:28.580   01:07:30.580  
   because you've got this
short     of  

01:07:30.580   01:07:30.590  
  short time on earth and there's lots of
  

01:07:30.590   01:07:32.080  
  short time on earth and there's lots of 
   to  

01:07:32.080   01:07:32.090  
   are very very difficult to
  

01:07:32.090   01:07:34.480  
   are very very difficult to 
   the  

01:07:34.480   01:07:34.490  
  contend with and and you have the
  

01:07:34.490   01:07:37.210  
  contend with and and you have the
problem     in  

01:07:37.210   01:07:37.220  
problem   of tolerating yourself even in
  

01:07:37.220   01:07:39.160  
problem   of tolerating yourself even in
all     the  

01:07:39.160   01:07:39.170  
all your insufficiency and   one of the
  

01:07:39.170   01:07:40.660  
all your insufficiency and   one of the
things     to     case  

01:07:40.660   01:07:40.670  
things that seems to me to   be the case
  

01:07:40.670   01:07:42.820  
things that seems to me to   be the case
is     sufficiently  

01:07:42.820   01:07:42.830  
is that   if you adopt a sufficiently
  

01:07:42.830   01:07:44.800  
is that   if you adopt a sufficiently
profound     being     to  

01:07:44.800   01:07:44.810  
profound mode of being   if you attempt to
  

01:07:44.810   01:07:48.340  
profound mode of being   if you attempt to 
   up  

01:07:48.340   01:07:48.350  
   then the mere act of lifting up
  

01:07:48.350   01:07:50.810  
   then the mere act of lifting up 
   justify  

01:07:50.810   01:07:50.820  
  that weight is enough to justify
  

01:07:50.820   01:07:52.790

enlightenment that's   it's right on the
border     of

border   between these two sets of
  

01:12:41.150   01:12:42.879  
border   between these two sets of
phenomena     that's     what  

01:12:42.879   01:12:42.889  
phenomena   kind of what
  

01:12:42.889   01:12:45.339  
phenomena   kind of what
that     picture     so  

01:12:45.339   01:12:45.349  
that   present and so
  

01:12:45.349   01:12:47.649  
that   present and so
you     way  

01:12:47.649   01:12:47.659  
you know it's a metaphor   that's one way
  

01:12:47.659   01:12:49.870  
you know it's a metaphor   that's one way 
   again  

01:12:49.870   01:12:49.880  
   but it does again
  

01:12:49.880   01:12:52.270  
   but it does again
allude     that  

01:12:52.270   01:12:52.280  
allude to   the underlying idea that
  

01:12:52.280   01:12:53.470  
allude to   the underlying idea that
there's     consciousness  

01:12:53.470   01:12:53.480  
there's something   about consciousness
  

01:12:53.480   01:12:57.700  
there's something   about consciousness
that's     God  

01:12:57.700   01:12:57.710  
  that's integral to to being itself God
  

01:12:57.710   01:12:58.959  
  that's integral to to being itself God

for seasons and for days and   for years 
   a  

01:13:07.720   01:13:07.730  
   a that's a remarkable bit of a
  

01:13:07.730   01:13:09.910  
   a that's a remarkable bit of a
bit     you  

01:13:09.910   01:13:09.920  
bit of writing there too   because you
  

01:13:09.920   01:13:11.770  
bit of writing there too   because you
just     think     took  

01:13:11.770   01:13:11.780  
just think   took
  

01:13:11.780   01:13:13.810  
just think   took
our     the  

01:13:13.810   01:13:13.820  
our caveman ancestors to look at the
 

01:13:13.820   01:13:16.180  
our caveman ancestors to look at the
night   that  

01:13:16.180   01:13:16.190  
night   out that
  

01:13:16.190   01:13:18.459  
night   out that
there     across  

01:13:18.459   01:13:18.469  
there were repeating patterns across
 

01:13:18.469   01:13:20.229  
there were repeating patterns across
   the  

01:13:20.229   01:13:20.239  
   to mark the
  

01:13:20.239   01:13:22.359  
   to mark the
seasons     I     how  

01:13:22.359   01:13:22.369  
seasons I mean I   how
  

01:13:22.369   01:13:24.759  
seasons I mean I   how
they    degree  

01:13:24.759   01:13:24.769  
they   that degree
  

01:13:24.769   01:13:27.100  
they   that degree 
   and  

01:13:27.100   01:13:27.110  
  of careful observation that it took and
  

01:13:27.110   01:13:28.839  
  of careful observation that it took and
I     a  

01:13:28.839   01:13:28.849  
I mean we know people figure that out a
 

01:13:28.849   01:13:31.870  
I mean we know people figure that out a
long   those  

01:13:31.870   01:13:31.880  
long   time ago because ah you know those
  

01:13:31.880   01:13:34.270  
long   time ago because ah you know those
great     like  

01:13:34.270   01:13:34.280  
great megalithic monuments like
 

01:13:34.280   01:13:37.109  
great megalithic monuments like
Stonehenge   astronomical  

01:13:37.109   01:13:37.119  
Stonehenge   seem to be astronomical
  

01:13:37.119   01:13:39.040  
Stonehenge   seem to be astronomical
observatories     see  

01:13:39.040   01:13:39.050  
observatories essentially and   you see
  

01:13:39.050   01:13:40.600  
observatories essentially and   you see
the     mean  

01:13:40.600   01:13:40.610  
the same thing with the pyramids I mean
 

01:13:40.610   01:13:42.220  
the same thing with the pyramids I mean
people     looking    sky  

01:13:42.220   01:13:42.230  
people were looking   at the damn sky
  

01:13:42.230   01:13:44.169  
people were looking   at the damn sky 
   you  

01:13:44.169   01:13:44.179  
  trying to figure out looking at God you
  

01:13:44.179   01:13:45.189  
  trying to figure out looking at God you
know     you're  

01:13:45.189   01:13:45.199  
know because that's kind of what   you're
  

01:13:45.199   01:13:46.330  
know because that's kind of what   you're
doing     you're     night

   know maybe you could maybe you
could     consider     of

could   Declaration of

   that
and     that     that  

01:15:40.960   01:15:40.970  
and I guess the answer   is that
  

01:15:40.970   01:15:43.150  
and I guess the answer   is that 
   and  

01:15:43.150   01:15:43.160  
   and

   and
I     but  

01:15:46.210   01:15:46.220  
I know that that's   not proof but but
  

01:15:46.220   01:15:47.770  
I know that that's   not proof but but
it's     it  

01:15:47.770   01:15:47.780  
it's still a remarkable fact that   it

it's still a remarkable fact that   it
happens     to     does

happens to   the case and no one does
know     is     go

know why that is   go
  

01:15:51.590   01:15:53.470  
know why that is   go

distasteful so I get any worm is a
parasite     in    it  

01:16:52.190   01:16:52.200  
parasite that lives in   it
  

01:16:52.200   01:16:54.260

long it's about   it's you
know    burrow  

01:16:58.100   01:16:58.110  
know   about that wide and so it'll burrow
  

01:16:58.110   01:16:59.720  
know   about that wide and so it'll burrow
underneath     in  

01:16:59.720   01:16:59.730  
underneath your leg and then it's in

there   and maybe it pokes its
little     is     of

little head out a hole which is   one of
its     and     if  

01:17:05.180   01:17:05.190  
its delightful tendencies and   then if
  

01:17:05.190   01:17:07.730  
its delightful tendencies and   then if
you     it     right  

01:17:07.730   01:17:07.740  
you want to   right
  

01:17:07.740   01:17:09.680  
you want to   right
because     you  

01:17:09.680   01:17:09.690  
because obviously because otherwise you
 

01:17:09.690   01:17:11.240  
because obviously because otherwise you
just   so  

01:17:11.240   01:17:11.250  
just   be dead and so
  

01:17:11.250   01:17:12.650  
just   be dead and so
it     breaks  

01:17:12.650   01:17:12.660  
it doesn't like   that so it just breaks
  

01:17:12.660   01:17:14.930  
it doesn't like   that so it just breaks
off     many     this

yeah well so good for him like you know
 

01:17:51.600   01:17:53.060  
yeah well so good for him like you know
I     the 

01:17:53.060   01:17:53.070  
I mean he can die thinking that the
 

01:17:53.070   01:17:54.470  
I mean he can die thinking that the
   when  

01:17:54.470   01:17:54.480  
   when
  

01:17:54.480   01:17:56.810  
   when 
   for  

01:17:56.810   01:17:56.820  
  he first popped out and so so good for
  

01:17:56.820   01:17:58.580  
  he first popped out and so so good for
that     NASA     good  

01:17:58.580   01:17:58.590  
that that   I think that's a good
  

01:17:58.590   01:18:01.880  
that that   I think that's a good
that's     a     to  

01:18:01.880   01:18:01.890  
that's a   think is to
  

01:18:01.890   01:18:03.320  
that's a   think is to
think     you're     deathbed  

01:18:03.320   01:18:03.330  
   on your deathbed
  

01:18:03.330   01:18:05.990  
   on your deathbed 
   there's  

01:18:05.990   01:18:06.000  
  you can look back and think well there's
  

01:18:06.000   01:18:07.160  
  you can look back and think well there's
a     world  

01:18:07.160   01:18:07.170  
a little   less suffering in the world
  

01:18:07.170   01:18:09.170  
a little   less suffering in the world
from     if  

01:18:09.170   01:18:09.180  
  from here on out than there would be if
  

01:18:09.180   01:18:11.000  
  from here on out than there would be if
I     that's     lot  

01:18:11.000   01:18:11.010  
I had never   a lot
  

01:18:11.010   01:18:12.680  
I had never   a lot
better    it's  

01:18:12.680   01:18:12.690  
better   than the opposite because it's
  

01:18:12.690   01:18:14.660  
better   than the opposite because it's 
   Stalin  

01:18:14.660   01:18:14.670  
  certainly possible say if you're Stalin
  

01:18:14.670   01:18:16.460  
  certainly possible say if you're Stalin
to     lot  

01:18:16.460   01:18:16.470  
to   ensure that there's a hell of a lot
  

01:18:16.470   01:18:17.810  
to   ensure that there's a hell of a lot
more    there  

01:18:17.810   01:18:17.820  
more   suffering in the world than there
  

01:18:17.820   01:18:19.700  
more   suffering in the world than there
would     and  

01:18:19.700   01:18:19.710  
would   have been if you hadn't lived and
  

01:18:19.710   01:18:21.170  
would   have been if you hadn't lived and
we    can  

01:18:21.170   01:18:21.180  
we   that people can
  

01:18:21.180   01:18:23.150  
we   that people can 
   people  

01:18:23.150   01:18:23.160  
  manage that and that many many people
  

01:18:23.160   01:18:26.270  
  manage that and that many many people 
   manage  

01:18:26.270   01:18:26.280  
   but in that but manage
  

01:18:26.280   01:18:29.210  
   but in that but manage
precisely     that     me  

01:18:29.210   01:18:29.220  
precisely   so and it's hard for me
  

01:18:29.220   01:18:30.910  
precisely   so and it's hard for me
not     to     of  

01:18:30.910   01:18:30.920  
not   that as some sort of
  

01:18:30.920   01:18:33.350  
not   that as some sort of 
   the  

01:18:33.350   01:18:33.360  
   and I think it's the
  

01:18:33.360   01:18:34.940  
   and I think it's the
right     to     was  

01:18:34.940   01:18:34.950  
right   look at it and there was
  

01:18:34.950   01:18:36.380  
right   look at it and there was
evening     morning.the     4th  

01:18:36.380   01:18:36.390  
evening and   4th
  

01:18:36.390   01:18:42.590  
evening and   4th
day     you     and  

01:18:42.590   01:18:42.600  
day so yeah you   have the Sun here and
  

01:18:42.600   01:18:47.640  
day so yeah you   have the Sun here and
then     far     tell  

01:18:47.640   01:18:47.650  
 
 

01:18:47.650   01:18:52.839  
 
yeah     yeah    the  

01:18:52.839   01:18:52.849  
yeah yeah   actually I think this is the
  

01:18:52.849   01:18:57.339  
yeah yeah   actually I think this is the
moon     over     that's  

01:18:57.339   01:18:57.349  
moon over   here but but so yeah that's
  

01:18:57.349   01:18:59.199  
moon over   here but but so yeah that's
part     you  

01:18:59.199   01:18:59.209  
part   of the Sistine Chapel which is you
  

01:18:59.209   01:19:01.540  
part   of the Sistine Chapel which is you
know     absolutely     then  

01:19:01.540   01:19:01.550  
know an absolutely   remarkable and then
  

01:19:01.550   01:19:02.890  
know an absolutely   remarkable and then
they     the     the  

01:19:02.890   01:19:02.900  
they know part of the   reason - and the
  

01:19:02.900   01:19:04.089  
they know part of the   reason - and the
part    about  

01:19:04.089   01:19:04.099  
part   of the reason I'm teaching about
  

01:19:04.099   01:19:06.399  
part   of the reason I'm teaching about
these     is     you  

01:19:06.399   01:19:06.409  
these biblical   because you
  

01:19:06.409   01:19:08.140  
these biblical   because you
know     because     humanities  

01:19:08.140   01:19:08.150  
know I'm thinking because   the humanities
  

01:19:08.150   01:19:11.049  
know I'm thinking because   the humanities
have     I  

01:19:11.049   01:19:11.059  
have be decimated   so badly and again I
  

01:19:11.059   01:19:12.250  
have be decimated   so badly and again I
think     with  

01:19:12.250   01:19:12.260  
think   that has mostly to do with
  

01:19:12.260   01:19:13.989  
think   that has mostly to do with
resentment    anything  

01:19:13.989   01:19:13.999  
resentment   and hatred more than anything
  

01:19:13.999   01:19:15.580  
resentment   and hatred more than anything
else    you  

01:19:15.580   01:19:15.590  
else   but I don't really think that you
  

01:19:15.590   01:19:18.129  
else   but I don't really think that you 
   and  

01:19:18.129   01:19:18.139  
   and
  

01:19:18.139   01:19:19.629  
   and
what     have     knowing  

01:19:19.629   01:19:19.639  
what they have   knowing
  

01:19:19.639   01:19:21.250  
what they have   knowing
the     the  

01:19:21.250   01:19:21.260  
the biblical stories because they're the
 

01:19:21.260   01:19:22.839  
the biblical stories because they're the
they're     the 

01:19:22.839   01:19:22.849  
they're the dream out of which the
 

01:19:22.849   01:19:25.180  
they're the dream out of which the
humanities     unless    have  

01:19:25.180   01:19:25.190  
humanities emerge and so unless   you have
  

01:19:25.190   01:19:27.310  
humanities emerge and so unless   you have 
   dream  

01:19:27.310   01:19:27.320  
   that dream
  

01:19:27.320   01:19:29.379  
   that dream
then     that  

01:19:29.379   01:19:29.389  
then there's all sorts of things   that
  

01:19:29.389   01:19:31.299  
then there's all sorts of things   that
are     don't     open  

01:19:31.299   01:19:31.309  
   open
  

01:19:31.309   01:19:33.189  
   open
themselves     Inferno  

01:19:33.189   01:19:33.199  
themselves up   to you and Dante's Inferno
  

01:19:33.199   01:19:34.629  
themselves up   to you and Dante's Inferno
would     those     Milton's  

01:19:34.629   01:19:34.639  
would be one of   and Milton's
  

01:19:34.639   01:19:36.339  
would be one of   and Milton's
Paradise     absolutely  

01:19:36.339   01:19:36.349  
Paradise   Lost which is an absolutely
  

01:19:36.349   01:19:38.620  
Paradise   Lost which is an absolutely
amazing     of     Milton  

01:19:38.620   01:19:38.630  
amazing   work I mean Milton
  

01:19:38.630   01:19:40.419  
amazing   work I mean Milton

01:25:15.630   01:25:18.230  
the cancer   and the earthquakes is kind
of     into     you  

01:25:18.230   01:25:18.240  
   and you
  

01:25:18.240   01:25:19.880  
   and you
know     to  

01:25:19.880   01:25:19.890  
know the terrible things that happen to
 

01:25:19.890   01:25:21.800  
know the terrible things that happen to
children   difficult

to     God  

01:25:23.480   01:25:23.490  
to square   with the notion of a good God
  

01:25:23.490   01:25:24.810  
to square   with the notion of a good God
obviously 

01:25:24.810   01:25:24.820  
  obviously
  

01:25:24.820   01:25:26.950  
  obviously
but     underlying  

01:25:26.950   01:25:26.960  
but then there's the   other underlying
  

01:25:26.960   01:25:31.180  
but then there's the   other underlying 
   manner  

01:25:31.180   01:25:31.190  
  idea is that if you act in that manner
  

01:25:31.190   01:25:34.840  
  idea is that if you act in that manner 
   it's  

01:25:34.840   01:25:34.850  
  it makes it more likely to be true it's
  

01:25:34.850   01:25:37.060  
  it makes it more likely to be true it's
something     that     I  

01:25:37.060   01:25:37.070  
something like that   and so it's that I
  

01:25:37.070   01:25:38.650  
something like that   and so it's that I
would     and  

01:25:38.650   01:25:38.660  
would   consider that in some sense and
  

01:25:38.660   01:25:40.930  
would   consider that in some sense and
active     like  

01:25:40.930   01:25:40.940  
active both courage and faith   it's like
  

01:25:40.940   01:25:43.000  
active both courage and faith   it's like
you're     going     God  

01:25:43.000   01:25:43.010  
you're   like God
  

01:25:43.010   01:25:45.520  
you're   like God
makes     the     that  

01:25:45.520   01:25:45.530  
makes at the beginning   that
  

01:25:45.530   01:25:49.300  
makes at the beginning   that
being     see  

01:25:49.300   01:25:49.310  
being is in fact good   now you can't see
  

01:25:49.310   01:25:51.400  
being is in fact good   now you can't see
it    the  

01:25:51.400   01:25:51.410  
it   get to see all the
  

01:25:51.410   01:25:52.630  
it   get to see all the 
   good  

01:25:52.630   01:25:52.640  
   aren't so good
  

01:25:52.640   01:25:53.710  
   aren't so good
that's     point  

01:25:53.710   01:25:53.720  
  that's not the point
  

01:25:53.720   01:25:56.500  
  that's not the point
it's     presupposition  

01:25:56.500   01:25:56.510  
it's a metaphysical presupposition
 

01:25:56.510   01:25:58.000  
it's a metaphysical presupposition
   a  

01:25:58.000   01:25:58.010  
   a it's a
  

01:25:58.010   01:26:00.610  
   a it's a 
   to  

01:26:00.610   01:26:00.620  
   way I'm going to
  

01:26:00.620   01:26:03.010  
   way I'm going to
act     further  

01:26:03.010   01:26:03.020  
  act as if being is good and to further
  

01:26:03.020   01:26:06.760  
  act as if being is good and to further
that     well  

01:26:06.760   01:26:06.770  
that   and then the implicit idea is well
  

01:26:06.770   01:26:08.230  
that   and then the implicit idea is well
there     isn't     isn't  

01:26:08.230   01:26:08.240  
there isn't   anything that there isn't
  

01:26:08.240   01:26:10.150  
there isn't   anything that there isn't 
   work  

01:26:10.150   01:26:10.160  
  any way that you can make things work
  

01:26:10.160   01:26:12.940  
  any way that you can make things work
out     do     so  

01:26:12.940   01:26:12.950  
out better than to do   and so
  

01:26:12.950   01:26:14.920  
out better than to do   and so
there's     which  

01:26:14.920   01:26:14.930  
there's a courageous   element to it which
  

01:26:14.930   01:26:17.260  
there's a courageous   element to it which 
   degree  

01:26:17.260   01:26:17.270  
  i think is also expressed to some degree
  

01:26:17.270   01:26:20.110  
  i think is also expressed to some degree
in     voluntary  

01:26:20.110   01:26:20.120  
in   the idea of Christ's like voluntary
  

01:26:20.120   01:26:22.020  
in   the idea of Christ's like voluntary 
   his  

01:26:22.020   01:26:22.030  
  sacrifice of his own life his
  

01:26:22.030   01:26:24.160  
  sacrifice of his own life his
presupposition     I'm  

01:26:24.160   01:26:24.170  
presupposition was something like I'm
 

01:26:24.170   01:26:26.440  
presupposition was something like I'm
   I'm  

01:26:26.440   01:26:26.450  
   is good and I'm
  

01:26:26.450   01:26:28.090  
   is good and I'm
going     out     end  

01:26:28.090   01:26:28.100  
going   right to the end
  

01:26:28.100   01:26:29.950  
going   right to the end
and     like     a  

01:26:29.950   01:26:29.960  
and now that   a
  

01:26:29.960   01:26:32.440  
and now that   a
divine     pattern     there's  

01:26:32.440   01:26:32.450  
divine pattern   and I believe there's
  

01:26:32.450   01:26:35.470  
divine pattern   and I believe there's
wisdom     again     of  

01:26:35.470   01:26:35.480  
wisdom in   I most of
  

01:26:35.480   01:26:37.030  
wisdom in   I most of 
   with  

01:26:37.030   01:26:37.040  
   been wrestling with

01:26:40.030   01:26:40.040  
  looking at the opposite I haven't been
  

01:26:40.040   01:26:41.980  
  looking at the opposite I haven't been
studying     evil  

01:26:41.980   01:26:41.990  
studying good I've been   studying evil
  

01:26:41.990   01:26:43.600  
studying good I've been   studying evil
because     easier     believe  

01:26:43.600   01:26:43.610  
because evil is easier   to believe
  

01:26:43.610   01:26:45.880  
because evil is easier   to believe 
   it's  

01:26:45.880   01:26:45.890  
  especially after the 20th century it's
  

01:26:45.890   01:26:47.860  
  especially after the 20th century it's
like    to  

01:26:47.860   01:26:47.870  
like   to
  

01:26:47.870   01:26:50.800  
like   to 
   things  

01:26:50.800   01:26:50.810  
   things
  

01:26:50.810   01:26:52.510  
   things 
   as  

01:26:52.510   01:26:52.520  
  that happened in the 20th century as
  

01:26:52.520   01:26:55.720  
  that happened in the 20th century as
evil     the     that  

01:26:55.720   01:26:55.730  
evil and then some of the   things that
  

01:26:55.730   01:26:57.460  
evil and then some of the   things that 
   just  

01:26:57.460   01:26:57.470  
  happen we're so brutal it is just
  

01:26:57.470   01:27:00.670  
  happen we're so brutal it is just
absolutely     unimaginable     unless  

01:27:00.670   01:27:00.680  
absolutely   and well unless
  

01:27:00.680   01:27:03.940  
absolutely   and well unless
you     it's  

01:27:03.940   01:27:03.950  
you imagine it and and it's it's it's
 

01:27:03.950   01:27:06.070  
you imagine it and and it's it's it's
right     part    historical  

01:27:06.070   01:27:06.080  
right there it's part   of the historical
  

01:27:06.080   01:27:08.170  
right there it's part   of the historical 
   if  

01:27:08.170   01:27:08.180  
   it and then I think well if
  

01:27:08.180   01:27:09.790  
   it and then I think well if
there's     that's     that  

01:27:09.790   01:27:09.800  
there's something   it's that
  

01:27:09.800   01:27:12.700  
there's something   it's that 
   as  

01:27:12.700   01:27:12.710  
  terrible it indicates as clearly as
  

01:27:12.710   01:27:14.830  
  terrible it indicates as clearly as
anything     something  

01:27:14.830   01:27:14.840  
anything can   that there's also something
  

01:27:14.840   01:27:17.200  
anything can   that there's also something 
   whatever  

01:27:17.200   01:27:17.210  
  that's its opposite and that's whatever
  

01:27:17.210   01:27:19.840  
  that's its opposite and that's whatever
it     possible  

01:27:19.840   01:27:19.850  
  it is that the farthest away possible
  

01:27:19.850   01:27:22.270  
  it is that the farthest away possible
from     mean  

01:27:22.270   01:27:22.280  
from that   outcome now that doesn't mean
  

01:27:22.280   01:27:24.130  
from that   outcome now that doesn't mean
we     say     because  

01:27:24.130   01:27:24.140  
we can exactly   because
  

01:27:24.140   01:27:27.250  
we can exactly   because
it's     what  

01:27:27.250   01:27:27.260  
  it's easier to grip in some sense what
  

01:27:27.260   01:27:29.350  
  it's easier to grip in some sense what
it     hurt  

01:27:29.350   01:27:29.360  
it means to torture   and break and hurt
  

01:27:29.360   01:27:31.450  
it means to torture   and break and hurt
and     conceptualize  

01:27:31.450   01:27:31.460  
and then not to be able   to conceptualize
  

01:27:31.460   01:27:33.550  
and then not to be able   to conceptualize
so     if  

01:27:33.550   01:27:33.560  
so clearly   how you would have to act if
  

01:27:33.560   01:27:35.410  
so clearly   how you would have to act if 
   opposite  

01:27:35.410   01:27:35.420  
  you were acting in the exact opposite
  

01:27:35.420   01:27:37.540  
  you were acting in the exact opposite
manner     but     it  

01:27:37.540   01:27:37.550  
manner   it
  

01:27:37.550   01:27:38.290  
manner   it
exists 

01:27:38.290   01:27:38.300  
exists
 

01:27:38.300   01:27:40.930  
exists
and     that    in  

01:27:40.930   01:27:40.940  
and I see that   out in
  

01:27:40.940   01:27:42.880  
and I see that   out in
this    New  

01:27:42.880   01:27:42.890  
this   in the New
  

01:27:42.890   01:27:44.500  
this   in the New 
   do  

01:27:44.500   01:27:44.510  
   to do
  

01:27:44.510   01:27:46.540  
   to do
with     and  

01:27:46.540   01:27:46.550  
with   well it has something to do and
  

01:27:46.550   01:27:49.690  
with   well it has something to do and
this     voluntary  

01:27:49.690   01:27:49.700  
this   is for sure with the voluntary
  

01:27:49.700   01:27:52.270  
this   is for sure with the voluntary
acceptance     because     of  

01:27:52.270   01:27:52.280  
acceptance of mortality   of
  

01:27:52.280   01:27:53.950  
acceptance of mortality   of
course     right  

01:27:53.950   01:27:53.960  
course that's   the poisoned apple right
  

01:27:53.960   01:27:55.510  
course that's   the poisoned apple right 
   forward  

01:27:55.510   01:27:55.520  
  the fact that everybody looks forward
  

01:27:55.520   01:27:57.220  
  the fact that everybody looks forward
into     that     you're  

01:27:57.220   01:27:57.230  
into the   you're
  

01:27:57.230   01:27:58.870  
into the   you're
finite     that     you  

01:27:58.870   01:27:58.880  
finite and so is everything   you
  

01:27:58.880   01:28:00.490  
finite and so is everything   you
love     that  

01:28:00.490   01:28:00.500  
  love and it's very difficult for that
  

01:28:00.500   01:28:03.520  
  love and it's very difficult for that 
   well  

01:28:03.520   01:28:03.530  
  not to poison your existence and well
  

01:28:03.530   01:28:05.830  
  not to poison your existence and well
there's     as  

01:28:05.830   01:28:05.840  
there's no   getting out of it as far as
  

01:28:05.840   01:28:07.690  
there's no   getting out of it as far as 
   something  

01:28:07.690   01:28:07.700  
  we can tell but there might be something
  

01:28:07.700   01:28:09.520  
  we can tell but there might be something 
   and  

01:28:09.520   01:28:09.530  
   and
  

01:28:09.530   01:28:11.320  
   and
you     you  

01:28:11.320   01:28:11.330  
you could say   well that's the price you
  

01:28:11.330   01:28:13.810  
you could say   well that's the price you
pay    do  

01:28:13.810   01:28:13.820  
pay   thing to do
  

01:28:13.820   01:28:15.910  
pay   thing to do
is     that     accept  

01:28:15.910   01:28:15.920  
is to accept that   even to accept
  

01:28:15.920   01:28:18.310  
is to accept that   even to accept 
   going  

01:28:18.310   01:28:18.320  
   I'm going
  

01:28:18.320   01:28:19.600  
   I'm going
to     go     to  

01:28:19.600   01:28:19.610  
to   to
  

01:28:19.610   01:28:21.490  
to   to
accept     going     act  

01:28:21.490   01:28:21.500  
   to act
  

01:28:21.500   01:28:24.130  
   to act 
   then  

01:28:24.130   01:28:24.140  
  nonetheless as if being is good and then
  

01:28:24.140   01:28:26.080  
  nonetheless as if being is good and then
I'm     things     out  

01:28:26.080   01:28:26.090  
I'm   turn out
  

01:28:26.090   01:28:29.530  
I'm   turn out 
   saw  

01:28:29.530   01:28:29.540  
  it's something like that and God saw
  

01:28:29.540   01:28:31.060  
  it's something like that and God saw
that     it     of  

01:28:31.060   01:28:31.070  
that it   and so it's an act of
  

01:28:31.070   01:28:33.610  
that it   and so it's an act of
courage     of  

01:28:33.610   01:28:33.620  
courage   right there there's an act of
  

01:28:33.620   01:28:35.170  
courage   right there there's an act of 
   that  

01:28:35.170   01:28:35.180  
  courage that's associated with that
  

01:28:35.180   01:28:37.510  
  courage that's associated with that
transformation     with  

01:28:37.510   01:28:37.520  
transformation of attitude and even with
 

01:28:37.520   01:28:39.160  
transformation of attitude and even with
regards   is  

01:28:39.160   01:28:39.170  
regards   is
  

01:28:39.170   01:28:40.780  
regards   is
good     courageous     attitude  

01:28:40.780   01:28:40.790  
good it's a courageous   attitude
  

01:28:40.790   01:28:43.090  
good it's a courageous   attitude 
   much  

01:28:43.090   01:28:43.100  
  especially given that there's so much
  

01:28:43.100   01:28:45.540  
  especially given that there's so much 
   conclusion  

01:28:45.540   01:28:45.550  
   that makes that conclusion
  

01:28:45.550   01:28:49.479  
   that makes that conclusion 
   the  

01:28:49.479   01:28:49.489  
  difficult to continually draw but the
  

01:28:49.489   01:28:52.950  
  difficult to continually draw but the
alternative     worse  

01:28:52.950   01:28:52.960  
alternative seems to me to be   far worse
  

01:28:52.960   01:28:55.420  
alternative seems to me to be   far worse
so     behind  

01:28:55.420   01:28:55.430  
so there's   God again with the Sun behind
  

01:28:55.430   01:28:58.750  
so there's   God again with the Sun behind 
   the  

01:28:58.750   01:28:58.760  
   the
  

01:28:58.760   01:29:01.540  
   the
solar     creating  

01:29:01.540   01:29:01.550  
  solar consciousness and he's creating
  

01:29:01.550   01:29:03.490  
  solar consciousness and he's creating
all     creatures  

01:29:03.490   01:29:03.500  
all these   strange wonderful creatures
  

01:29:03.500   01:29:07.330  
all these   strange wonderful creatures
and     and     say  

01:29:07.330   01:29:07.340  
and and you know it's a and   people say
  

01:29:07.340   01:29:09.160  
and and you know it's a and   people say
well     idea     an  

01:29:09.160   01:29:09.170  
well you know the idea   as a an
  

01:29:09.170   01:29:11.970  
well you know the idea   as a an
old     man     that's  

01:29:11.970   01:29:11.980  
old man   in the sky let's say that's
  

01:29:11.980   01:29:14.440  
old man   in the sky let's say that's
primitive     think  

01:29:14.440   01:29:14.450  
primitive it's much   more better to think
  

01:29:14.450   01:29:18.810  
primitive it's much   more better to think
about     better     Jesus  

01:29:18.810   01:29:18.820  
about it as a much more better   Jesus
  

01:29:18.820   01:29:21.790  
about it as a much more better   Jesus 
   think  

01:29:21.790   01:29:21.800  
   it's more sophisticated to think
  

01:29:21.800   01:29:23.770  
   it's more sophisticated to think
to    a  

01:29:23.770   01:29:23.780  
to   think of the divine essence as a
  

01:29:23.780   01:29:25.420  
to   think of the divine essence as a
disembodied     like  

01:29:25.420   01:29:25.430  
disembodied spirit or   something like
  

01:29:25.430   01:29:27.220  
disembodied spirit or   something like
that     you     that's  

01:29:27.220   01:29:27.230  
that   that's not so that's
  

01:29:27.230   01:29:29.470  
that   that's not so that's 
   I  

01:29:29.470   01:29:29.480  
  not so obvious either because as I
  

01:29:29.480   01:29:31.150  
  not so obvious either because as I
already     anything  

01:29:31.150   01:29:31.160  
already pointed   out there isn't anything
  

01:29:31.160   01:29:32.830  
already pointed   out there isn't anything 
   human  

01:29:32.830   01:29:32.840  
   than a human
  

01:29:32.840   01:29:35.860  
   than a human 
   the  

01:29:35.860   01:29:35.870  
  being and and so the idea that the
  

01:29:35.870   01:29:38.290  
  being and and so the idea that the
divine     as  

01:29:38.290   01:29:38.300  
divine is something that's at least as
 

01:29:38.300   01:29:40.330  
divine is something that's at least as
complicated     me 

01:29:40.330   01:29:40.340  
complicated as a human being strikes me
 

01:29:40.340   01:29:42.030  
complicated as a human being strikes me
as   quite  

01:29:42.030   01:29:42.040  
as   quite
  

01:29:42.040   01:29:44.500  
as   quite 
   metaphor  

01:29:44.500   01:29:44.510  
  reasonable and I know it's a metaphor
  

01:29:44.510   01:29:46.060  
  reasonable and I know it's a metaphor
although     don't     it  

01:29:46.060   01:29:46.070  
although I don't   degree it
  

01:29:46.070   01:29:47.500  
although I don't   degree it
is    something  

01:29:47.500   01:29:47.510  
is   it's also something
  

01:29:47.510   01:29:50.229  
is   it's also something
that's    also  

01:29:50.229   01:29:50.239  
that's   embodied and I really that's also
  

01:29:50.239   01:29:51.610  
that's   embodied and I really that's also
a    notion  

01:29:51.610   01:29:51.620  
a   very interesting notion
  

01:29:51.620   01:29:52.570  
a   very interesting notion
you     become  

01:29:52.570   01:29:52.580  
you know because it's become
 

01:29:52.580   01:29:55.210  
you know because it's become
increasingly   do  

01:29:55.210   01:29:55.220  
increasingly   to do
  

01:29:55.220   01:29:57.070  
increasingly   to do
such     as     artificial  

01:29:57.070   01:29:57.080  
such things as   produce artificial
  

01:29:57.080   01:29:59.500  
such things as   produce artificial
intelligence     to  

01:29:59.500   01:29:59.510  
intelligence that   it's very difficult to
  

01:29:59.510   01:30:01.690  
intelligence that   it's very difficult to
produce     a  

01:30:01.690   01:30:01.700  
produce   an intelligence or perhaps a
  

01:30:01.700   01:30:03.850  
produce   an intelligence or perhaps a
consciousness     in  

01:30:03.850   01:30:03.860  
consciousness   that isn't embodied in
  

01:30:03.860   01:30:06.640  
consciousness   that isn't embodied in
some     manner     be  

01:30:06.640   01:30:06.650  
some manner   just it can't be
  

01:30:06.650   01:30:09.310  
some manner   just it can't be
just     spirit     form  

01:30:09.310   01:30:09.320  
just   without form
  

01:30:09.320   01:30:11.050  
just   without form 
   to  

01:30:11.050   01:30:11.060  
  and I think that's part of the reason to
  

01:30:11.060   01:30:14.080  
  and I think that's part of the reason to 
   at  

01:30:14.080   01:30:14.090  
   so much emphasis at
  

01:30:14.090   01:30:15.790  
   so much emphasis at
the     of

the end of time on the   resurrection of
  

01:30:15.800   01:30:18.670  
the end of time on the   resurrection of 
   a  

01:30:18.670   01:30:18.680

there's   to
ennoble     just  

01:30:24.010   01:30:24.020  
  ennoble the idea of the body not just
  

01:30:24.020   01:30:26.950  
  ennoble the idea of the body not just
the     consciousness     floats  

01:30:26.950   01:30:26.960  
the   that floats
  

01:30:26.960   01:30:29.020  
the   that floats
abstractly     say  

01:30:29.020   01:30:29.030  
abstractly above the body but   to say

abstractly above the body but   to say
that    just  

01:30:31.480   01:30:31.490  
that   do that you can't just
  

01:30:31.490   01:30:33.910  
that   do that you can't just
shed     and  

01:30:33.910   01:30:33.920  
shed that part of you that's   heavy and
  

01:30:33.920   01:30:35.860  
shed that part of you that's   heavy and
material     behind

  Noble and Noble that as well and that
idea     to     the

   the note to the
  

01:30:42.800   01:30:45.340  
   the note to the
representation     human  

01:30:45.340   01:30:45.350  
representation   of God as as a human
  

01:30:45.350   01:30:48.220  
representation   of God as as a human
being     as  

01:30:48.220   01:30:48.230  
being and as a wise human   being and as
  

01:30:48.230   01:30:50.980  
being and as a wise human   being and as 
   at  

01:30:50.980   01:30:50.990  
   that's embodied and so at
  

01:30:50.990   01:30:52.750  
   that's embodied and so at 
   perspective  

01:30:52.750   01:30:52.760  
  least from the metaphorical perspective
  

01:30:52.760   01:30:54.820  
  least from the metaphorical perspective
I    to  

01:30:54.820   01:30:54.830  
I   don't think it's reasonable just to to
  

01:30:54.830   01:30:56.860  
I   don't think it's reasonable just to to
brush     across     well  

01:30:56.860   01:30:56.870  
brush your hands   it and say well
  

01:30:56.870   01:30:58.990  
brush your hands   it and say well
that's     because     don't  

01:30:58.990   01:30:59.000  
that's that's primitive   I don't

   he
  

01:34:35.719   01:34:37.750  
   he
created     because  

01:34:37.750   01:34:37.760  
created them that's   interesting because
  

01:34:37.760   01:34:40.120  
created them that's   interesting because
there     in  

01:34:40.120   01:34:40.130  
there is more   than one creation story in
  

01:34:40.130   01:34:42.280  
there is more   than one creation story in
Genesis     and  

01:34:42.280   01:34:42.290  
Genesis   and in this story males and
  

01:34:42.290   01:34:43.720  
Genesis   and in this story males and
females     the  

01:34:43.720   01:34:43.730  
females   are basically created at the
  

01:34:43.730   01:34:47.140  
females   are basically created at the 
   of  

01:34:47.140   01:34:47.150  
   of
  

01:34:47.150   01:34:49.390  
   of 
   not  

01:34:49.390   01:34:49.400  
   but not
  

01:34:49.400   01:34:51.939  
   but not
here    generated  

01:34:51.939   01:34:51.949  
here   it's the two sexes are generated
  

01:34:51.949   01:34:53.500  
here   it's the two sexes are generated
simultaneously     carry  

01:34:53.500   01:34:53.510  
simultaneously and they both carry
 

01:34:53.510   01:34:56.169  
simultaneously and they both carry
within     them    is  

01:34:56.169   01:34:56.179  
within them   the divine stamp which is
  

01:34:56.179   01:34:58.450  
within them   the divine stamp which is
very     appropriate  

01:34:58.450   01:34:58.460  
very egalitarian   and very appropriate
  

01:34:58.460   01:35:00.310  
very egalitarian   and very appropriate
and     that  

01:35:00.310   01:35:00.320  
and I think unbelievably advanced   that
  

01:35:00.320   01:35:02.680  
and I think unbelievably advanced   that
that's     to     God  

01:35:02.680   01:35:02.690  
that's what it looks like to   me and God
  

01:35:02.690   01:35:04.510  
that's what it looks like to   me and God
blessed    thing  

01:35:04.510   01:35:04.520  
blessed   thing
  

01:35:04.520   01:35:06.790  
blessed   thing
and     said     and  

01:35:06.790   01:35:06.800  
and God said   be fruitful and
  

01:35:06.800   01:35:08.350  
and God said   be fruitful and
multiply    subdue  

01:35:08.350   01:35:08.360  
multiply   subdue
  

01:35:08.360   01:35:10.120  
multiply   subdue

01:35:13.270   01:35:13.280  
   living thing that
  

01:35:13.280   01:35:16.570  
   living thing that

01:35:16.580   01:35:20.229  
   the earth and there's God
creating     they're  

01:35:20.229   01:35:20.239  
creating Adam and Eve   and they're
  

01:35:20.239   01:35:21.280  
creating Adam and Eve   and they're
looking     pretty     whole  

01:35:21.280   01:35:21.290  
looking pretty   about the whole
  

01:35:21.290   01:35:25.840  
looking pretty   about the whole 
   famous  

01:35:25.840   01:35:25.850  
  thing and that's Michelangelo's famous
  

01:35:25.850   01:35:28.090  
  thing and that's Michelangelo's famous
Sistine     and  

01:35:28.090   01:35:28.100  
Sistine Chapel representation and
 

01:35:28.100   01:35:29.680  
Sistine Chapel representation and
there's     cool    I  

01:35:29.680   01:35:29.690  
there's some cool   things about this I
  

01:35:29.690   01:35:32.320  
there's some cool   things about this I 
   a  

01:35:32.320   01:35:32.330  
   this this is a
  

01:35:32.330   01:35:35.950  
   this this is a
side     credible  

01:35:35.950   01:35:35.960  
side and I don't   know if it's a credible
  

01:35:35.960   01:35:37.900  
side and I don't   know if it's a credible
side     interesting     so  

01:35:37.900   01:35:37.910  
side but it's an interesting   aside so
  

01:35:37.910   01:35:39.760  
side but it's an interesting   aside so
that's     that's     what  

01:35:39.760   01:35:39.770  
that's that's   a form of credible what
  

01:35:39.770   01:35:41.680  
that's that's   a form of credible what
the     thing     now  

01:35:41.680   01:35:41.690  
the hell is God   now
  

01:35:41.690   01:35:45.370  
the hell is God   now
I     mean     so  

01:35:45.370   01:35:45.380  
   and and so
  

01:35:45.380   01:35:47.320  
   and and so
there's    to  

01:35:47.320   01:35:47.330  
there's   to
  

01:35:47.330   01:35:49.959  
there's   to
that     and     there  

01:35:49.959   01:35:49.969  
that   this is one of them so there
  

01:35:49.969   01:35:51.640  
that   this is one of them so there
was     group     years  

01:35:51.640   01:35:51.650  
was a group   20 years
  

01:35:51.650   01:35:54.220  
was a group   20 years 
   the  

01:35:54.220   01:35:54.230  
   the
  

01:35:54.230   01:35:58.450  
   the
precise     this  

01:35:58.450   01:35:58.460  
precise   the precise analogy between this
  

01:35:58.460   01:36:02.020  
precise   the precise analogy between this
structure     down  

01:36:02.020   01:36:02.030  
structure and the brain bisected down
 

01:36:02.030   01:36:03.939  
structure and the brain bisected down
the     middle    Michelangelo  

01:36:03.939   01:36:03.949  
the middle   and of course Michelangelo
  

01:36:03.949   01:36:05.200  
the middle   and of course Michelangelo 
   did  

01:36:05.200   01:36:05.210  
   who did
  

01:36:05.210   01:36:09.580  
   who did
detailed     dissections     felt  

01:36:09.580   01:36:09.590  
detailed dissections   and so they felt
  

01:36:09.590   01:36:13.390  
detailed dissections   and so they felt
that     God  

01:36:13.390   01:36:13.400  
that that that Michelangelo   had put God
  

01:36:13.400   01:36:16.050  
that that that Michelangelo   had put God
inside     and  

01:36:16.050   01:36:16.060  
inside the brain for   some reason and
  

01:36:16.060   01:36:18.490  
inside the brain for   some reason and
that     to     with  

01:36:18.490   01:36:18.500  
that seems to   with
  

01:36:18.500   01:36:20.620  
that seems to   with
the     notion     there's  

01:36:20.620   01:36:20.630  
the notion   that there's you know there's
  

01:36:20.630   01:36:22.930  
the notion   that there's you know there's
a    metaphorical  

01:36:22.930   01:36:22.940  
a   there's an analogy or metaphorical
  

01:36:22.940   01:36:24.640  
a   there's an analogy or metaphorical
identity    whatever  

01:36:24.640   01:36:24.650  
identity   notion of whatever
  

01:36:24.650   01:36:26.290  
identity   notion of whatever 
   rise  

01:36:26.290   01:36:26.300  
   give rise
  

01:36:26.300   01:36:31.600  
   give rise 
   really  

01:36:31.600   01:36:31.610  
   and I think we really
  

01:36:31.610   01:36:32.470  
   and I think we really
underestimate     the  

01:36:32.470   01:36:32.480  
  underestimate the
  

01:36:32.480   01:36:34.840  
  underestimate the
degree     which     both  

01:36:34.840   01:36:34.850  
degree to which   both
  

01:36:34.850   01:36:37.690  
degree to which   both
say     I  

01:36:37.690   01:36:37.700  
  say miraculous and and not understood I
  

01:36:37.700   01:36:41.230  
  say miraculous and and not understood I

it's   really a crazily remarkable thing
you     know     lot  

01:37:04.240   01:37:04.250  
you know   hear a lot
  

01:37:04.250   01:37:06.130  
you know   hear a lot
about     I'll  

01:37:06.130   01:37:06.140  
about scientific reductionism but I'll
 

01:37:06.140   01:37:07.180  
about scientific reductionism but I'll
tell     you    of  

01:37:07.180   01:37:07.190  
tell you   something that's kind of
  

01:37:07.190   01:37:08.770  
tell you   something that's kind of
interesting    to  

01:37:08.770   01:37:08.780  
interesting   this it's a tangent to
  

01:37:08.780   01:37:10.840  
interesting   this it's a tangent to
you     that     I  

01:37:10.840   01:37:10.850  
you know the guy that   discovered DNA I
  

01:37:10.850   01:37:13.150  
you know the guy that   discovered DNA I
think     in  

01:37:13.150   01:37:13.160  
think it was Watson   and just walks in
  

01:37:13.160   01:37:14.470  
think it was Watson   and just walks in
and    wrote  

01:37:14.470   01:37:14.480  
and   wrote
  

01:37:14.480   01:37:17.710  
and   wrote
this     of     don't  

01:37:17.710   01:37:17.720  
this book   I don't
  

01:37:17.720   01:37:19.900  
this book   I don't 
   DNA  

01:37:19.900   01:37:19.910  
   he believed the DNA
  

01:37:19.910   01:37:21.490  
   he believed the DNA 
   come  

01:37:21.490   01:37:21.500  
   come
  

01:37:21.500   01:37:23.560

   he didn't believe it could
  

01:37:23.570   01:37:25.870  
   he didn't believe it could 
   so  

01:37:25.870   01:37:25.880  
   and so
  

01:37:25.880   01:37:28.270  
   and so
like     a     used  

01:37:28.270   01:37:28.280  
like a   lot of these people who are used
  

01:37:28.280   01:37:31.720  
like a   lot of these people who are used
as     reductionism  

01:37:31.720   01:37:31.730  
as exemplars   of scientific reductionism
  

01:37:31.730   01:37:32.920  
as exemplars   of scientific reductionism 
   you  

01:37:32.920   01:37:32.930  
   all when you
  

01:37:32.930   01:37:34.450  
   all when you
actually     read     right  

01:37:34.450   01:37:34.460  
actually read   what they had to say right
  

01:37:34.460   01:37:36.490  
actually read   what they had to say right
they     were     limits  

01:37:36.490   01:37:36.500  
they   the limits
  

01:37:36.500   01:37:38.650  
they   the limits 
   is  

01:37:38.650   01:37:38.660  
  of their own knowledge and I mean DNA is
  

01:37:38.660   01:37:41.080  
  of their own knowledge and I mean DNA is
something     spectacular     Lee  

01:37:41.080   01:37:41.090  
something really quite spectacular   Lee
  

01:37:41.090   01:37:43.270  
something really quite spectacular   Lee
remarkable     an     substance

01:37:44.810   01:37:46.390  
it's been around for a   very long time

   I
  

01:37:49.130   01:37:51.340  
   I
would     that     to  

01:37:51.340   01:37:51.350

don't understand at all
so     it's    that  

01:37:58.360   01:37:58.370  
so it's   I think that
  

01:37:58.370   01:38:00.160  
so it's   I think that
and     enough  

01:38:00.160   01:38:00.170  
and it   maybe Michelangelo had enough
  

01:38:00.170   01:38:01.960  
and it   maybe Michelangelo had enough
gall     certainly     possible  

01:38:01.960   01:38:01.970  
gall to do that it's certainly   possible
  

01:38:01.970   01:38:03.790  
gall to do that it's certainly   possible
I     do  

01:38:03.790   01:38:03.800  
I mean he had enough gall to do
 

01:38:03.800   01:38:06.520  
I mean he had enough gall to do

of the things we were always trying to
figure   you  

01:40:08.189   01:40:08.199  
figure   out was well how much should you

figure   out was well how much should you
work     you     work  

01:40:11.100   01:40:11.110  
work because one   just work
  

01:40:11.110   01:40:12.629  
work because one   just work 
   just  

01:40:12.629   01:40:12.639  
   he just
  

01:40:12.639   01:40:15.030

that's not   you have
  

01:40:17.830   01:40:19.169  
that's not   you have
to     figure     idea  

01:40:19.169   01:40:19.179  
to figure   why that isn't a good idea
  

01:40:19.179   01:40:21.240  
to figure   why that isn't a good idea 
   is  

01:40:21.240   01:40:21.250  
  it's got to be something like this is

01:40:35.669   01:40:35.679  
for a month   isn't very
  

01:40:35.679   01:40:37.919  
for a month   isn't very
productive     figure     how  

01:40:37.919   01:40:37.929  
productive so you have to   out how
  

01:40:37.929   01:40:40.410  
productive so you have to   out how
much     then  

01:40:40.410   01:40:40.420  
much you can work diligently and then
 

01:40:40.420   01:40:42.060  
much you can work diligently and then
how   that  

01:40:42.060   01:40:42.070  
how   that
  

01:40:42.070   01:40:44.070  
how   that
you     back     and  

01:40:44.070   01:40:44.080  
you can   up and work again and
  

01:40:44.080   01:40:45.680  
you can   up and work again and
you     basically  

01:40:45.680   01:40:45.690  
you know that's people have basically
 

01:40:45.690   01:40:48.060  
you know that's people have basically
   given  

01:40:48.060   01:40:48.070

  wonder because you have to work but you 
   of  

01:40:57.180   01:40:57.190

   iterative  

01:41:04.010   01:41:04.020  
  think it's more a matter of iterative
  

01:41:04.020   01:41:06.360  
  think it's more a matter of iterative 
   the  

01:41:06.360   01:41:06.370  
   you know because one of the
  

01:41:06.370   01:41:08.640  
   you know because one of the
things     that     the  

01:41:08.640   01:41:08.650  
things that   defines morality is the
  

01:41:08.650   01:41:11.220  
things that   defines morality is the
capacity     if  

01:41:11.220   01:41:11.230  
capacity to repeat something right so if
 

01:41:11.230   01:41:13.229  
capacity to repeat something right so if
something     is    a

something is   structured in a

something is   structured in a
moral     then     and  

01:41:15.240   01:41:15.250  
moral manner then   it over and
  

01:41:15.250   01:41:16.410  
moral manner then   it over and 
   any  

01:41:16.410   01:41:16.420  
   and over again without any
  

01:41:16.420   01:41:18.660  
   and over again without any
degeneration    like  

01:41:18.660   01:41:18.670  
degeneration   of like
  

01:41:18.670   01:41:20.490  
degeneration   of like
a    is

sort of come to   that
  

01:42:20.800   01:42:23.360  
sort of come to   that 
   to  

01:42:23.360   01:42:23.370  
  they're there there's an attempt to
  

01:42:23.370   01:42:26.970  
  they're there there's an attempt to
abstract     from

abstract out the   nature of power from
  

01:42:26.980   01:42:29.340  
abstract out the   nature of power from
specific     there's  

01:42:29.340   01:42:29.350  
specific aspects   of power and there's
  

01:42:29.350   01:42:31.129  
specific aspects   of power and there's
some     attempt     with  

01:42:31.129   01:42:31.139  
some attempt   to associate that with
  

01:42:31.139   01:42:33.600  
some attempt   to associate that with 
   rise  

01:42:33.600   01:42:33.610  
   as that which gives rise

   as that which gives rise 
   attempt  

01:42:35.820   01:42:35.830  
   and there's some attempt

   with
something     quality  

01:42:39.720   01:42:39.730  
something that has a cosmic quality
 

01:42:39.730   01:42:42.990  
something that has a cosmic quality
whatever   a  

01:42:42.990   01:42:43.000  
whatever   and and it's a
  

01:42:43.000   01:42:45.419  
whatever   and and it's a
statement     that     quality  

01:42:45.419   01:42:45.429  
statement that   it has a cosmic quality
  

01:42:45.429   01:42:48.030  
statement that   it has a cosmic quality 
   it's  

01:42:48.030   01:42:48.040  
   it's
  

01:42:48.040   01:42:49.979  
   it's
a     that  

01:42:49.979   01:42:49.989  
a mere statement that there's that
 

01:42:49.989   01:42:51.090  
a mere statement that there's that
   consciousness  

01:42:51.090   01:42:51.100  
  there's something about consciousness
  

01:42:51.100   01:42:53.550  
  there's something about consciousness 
   significance  

01:42:53.550   01:42:53.560  
  that has world generating significance
  

01:42:53.560   01:42:55.140  
  that has world generating significance
and     it's  

01:42:55.140   01:42:55.150  
and also the implication that   it's
  

01:42:55.150   01:42:57.780  
and also the implication that   it's
associated    well  

01:42:57.780   01:42:57.790  
associated   with human beings as well
  

01:42:57.790   01:43:00.360  
associated   with human beings as well
very     very     of  

01:43:00.360   01:43:00.370  
very and it's a very   of
  

01:43:00.370   01:43:01.860  
very and it's a very   of
propositions    that  

01:43:01.860   01:43:01.870  
propositions   believe that
  

01:43:01.870   01:43:04.740  
propositions   believe that
they're     refutable     a  

01:43:04.740   01:43:04.750  
they're simply refutable   like it's a
  

01:43:04.750   01:43:06.450  
they're simply refutable   like it's a
perfectly     though  

01:43:06.450   01:43:06.460  
perfectly coherent argument even   though
  

01:43:06.460   01:43:08.189  
perfectly coherent argument even   though
it's     and  

01:43:08.189   01:43:08.199  
  it's primarily made metaphorically and
  

01:43:08.199   01:43:10.500  
  it's primarily made metaphorically and
so     again     up  

01:43:10.500   01:43:10.510  
so then once again   want to build up
  

01:43:10.510   01:43:11.420  
so then once again   want to build up
the 

01:43:11.420   01:43:11.430  
the
 

01:43:11.430   01:43:14.150  
the
the     around    the  

01:43:14.150   01:43:14.160  
the framework of associations around   the
  

01:43:14.160   01:43:16.850  
the framework of associations around   the
idea     Freud  

01:43:16.850   01:43:16.860  
idea of   God one of the things that Freud
  

01:43:16.860   01:43:18.680  
idea of   God one of the things that Freud
did     and  

01:43:18.680   01:43:18.690  
did when he was interpreting dreams and
 

01:43:18.690   01:43:20.690  
did when he was interpreting dreams and
it's     useful    someone  

01:43:20.690   01:43:20.700  
it's quite useful   know so if someone
  

01:43:20.700   01:43:22.970  
it's quite useful   know so if someone 
   have  

01:43:22.970   01:43:22.980  
   a dream then I have
  

01:43:22.980   01:43:25.490  
   a dream then I have
them     me     I  

01:43:25.490   01:43:25.500  
them tell me   the whole dream and then I
  

01:43:25.500   01:43:28.190  
them tell me   the whole dream and then I
get     by     and  

01:43:28.190   01:43:28.200  
get them to repeat it   and
  

01:43:28.200   01:43:31.700  
get them to repeat it   and
then     it  

01:43:31.700   01:43:31.710  
then whenever they say a line and it
 

01:43:31.710   01:43:33.560  
then whenever they say a line and it
there's     object    or  

01:43:33.560   01:43:33.570  
there's an object   in it or a person or
  

01:43:33.570   01:43:35.030

partly formulated and then if you
discuss     amplify    you  

01:44:25.850   01:44:25.860

  make it concrete but but it doesn't do 
   just  

01:44:44.390   01:44:44.400  
  that in one fell swoop it doesn't just

  that in one fell swoop it doesn't just 
   two

01:44:49.070   01:44:49.080  
articulated ideas it has to dream up
 

01:44:49.080   01:44:51.140  
articulated ideas it has to dream up
what's     there    its  

01:44:51.140   01:44:51.150  
what's out there   first projects its

what     it     that's  

01:44:55.040   01:44:55.050  
what it   might be it then that's
  

01:44:55.050   01:44:56.630  
what it   might be it then that's
presented     you  

01:44:56.630   01:44:56.640  
presented   in the dream and if you
  

01:44:56.640   01:44:58.130  
presented   in the dream and if you
analyze     more  

01:44:58.130   01:44:58.140  
analyze   the dream you can make it more
  

01:44:58.140   01:45:00.860  
analyze   the dream you can make it more
articulate     we're  

01:45:00.860   01:45:00.870  
articulate   and so that's what we're
  

01:45:00.870   01:45:02.330  
articulate   and so that's what we're
going     of     God

  to build up the representational
structure    the  

01:45:06.890   01:45:06.900  
structure   bit so so the
  

01:45:06.900   01:45:09.290  
structure   bit so so the
hypothesis     is     abstracted  

01:45:09.290   01:45:09.300  
hypothesis is that   an abstracted
  

01:45:09.300   01:45:11.660  
hypothesis is that   an abstracted
ideal     to

01:45:21.080   01:45:21.090  
  the ruler becomes the ideal the state

  the ruler becomes the ideal the state
turns     the  

01:45:23.210   01:45:23.220  
turns   into the biblical Egypt and the
  

01:45:23.220   01:45:25.009  
turns   into the biblical Egypt and the 
   tyranny  

01:45:25.009   01:45:25.019  
  biblical Egypt is a tyranny
  

01:45:25.019   01:45:27.919  
  biblical Egypt is a tyranny
and     so     in  

01:45:27.919   01:45:27.929  
and so   there's a very very solid idea in
  

01:45:27.929   01:45:29.839  
and so   there's a very very solid idea in
the     Testament     took  

01:45:29.839   01:45:29.849  
the Old Testament   that I think took
  

01:45:29.849   01:45:31.879  
the Old Testament   that I think took
people     to     figure  

01:45:31.879   01:45:31.889  
people god only knows how long to   figure

   immediately  

01:45:42.680   01:45:42.690  
  then your culture immediately
  

01:45:42.690   01:45:45.109  
  then your culture immediately
degenerated     and  

01:45:45.109   01:45:45.119  
degenerated into totalitarian state and
 

01:45:45.119   01:45:47.870  
degenerated into totalitarian state and
turned     and    then  

01:45:47.870   01:45:47.880  
turned to stone and   then
  

01:45:47.880   01:45:49.640  
turned to stone and   then
you     slaves     was  

01:45:49.640   01:45:49.650  
you were slaves   and then the thing was

  how big and grandiose as soon as the
ruler     of  

01:45:56.660   01:45:56.670  
ruler became the concrete incarnation   of
  

01:45:56.670   01:45:58.339  
ruler became the concrete incarnation   of
the     distinction  

01:45:58.339   01:45:58.349  
the ideal there was no distinction
 

01:45:58.349   01:46:01.040  
the ideal there was no distinction
between     and    of

the ideal then the   society was doomed 
   think  

01:46:05.299   01:46:05.309  
   think that that's a less I think

that's what I think   that's true it's
  

01:46:07.860   01:46:10.279  
that's what I think   that's true it's
just     as     we  

01:46:10.279   01:46:10.289  
just   we
  

01:46:10.289   01:46:12.739  
just   we
saw     evidence     in  

01:46:12.739   01:46:12.749  
saw more   of that in

saw more   of that in
the    certainly

the   and we're certainly
  

01:46:14.369   01:46:15.830  
the   and we're certainly
seeing     itself  

01:46:15.830   01:46:15.840  
seeing the same thing repeating itself
 

01:46:15.840   01:46:18.259  
seeing the same thing repeating itself
now   the  

01:46:18.259   01:46:18.269  
now   when the ruler becomes the ideal the
  

01:46:18.269   01:46:20.120  
now   when the ruler becomes the ideal the
state     and  

01:46:20.120   01:46:20.130  
state turns into   the biblical Egypt and
  

01:46:20.130   01:46:21.620  
state turns into   the biblical Egypt and
the     archetypal  

01:46:21.620   01:46:21.630  
the biblical   Egypt is the archetypal
  

01:46:21.630   01:46:25.549  
the biblical   Egypt is the archetypal
tyranny     so     from  

01:46:25.549   01:46:25.559  
   well from
  

01:46:25.559   01:46:29.989  
   well from
the     three  

01:46:29.989   01:46:29.999  
the Christian perspective there's three
 

01:46:29.999   01:46:31.910

   something  

01:46:31.910   01:46:31.920  
  elements one is seems to have something
  

01:46:31.920   01:46:34.370  
  elements one is seems to have something
to     God  

01:46:34.370   01:46:34.380  
  to do with tradition and so that's God
  

01:46:34.380   01:46:36.109  
  to do with tradition and so that's God
the     the  

01:46:36.109   01:46:36.119  
the Father and that's partly   the
  

01:46:36.119   01:46:38.750  
the Father and that's partly   the
embodiment     the     human

embodiment   human
  

01:46:38.760   01:46:40.850

01:46:43.129   01:46:43.139  
thing and it's also partly the
 

01:46:43.139   01:46:45.470  
thing and it's also partly the
embodiment     of    human  

01:46:45.470   01:46:45.480  
embodiment of the tradition of   human
  

01:46:45.480   01:46:47.029  
embodiment of the tradition of   human
beings     very     ancient  

01:46:47.029   01:46:47.039  
beings which is also   ancient
  

01:46:47.039   01:46:49.220  
beings which is also   ancient
thing     that's     said  

01:46:49.220   01:46:49.230  
thing and that's   the structure as I said
  

01:46:49.230   01:46:51.739  
thing and that's   the structure as I said
it's     consciousness  

01:46:51.739   01:46:51.749  
it's the   structure that consciousness
  

01:46:51.749   01:46:54.319  
it's the   structure that consciousness
emerges     from     grapple  

01:46:54.319   01:46:54.329  
emerges from   that enables us to grapple
  

01:46:54.329   01:46:56.390  
emerges from   that enables us to grapple 
   then  

01:46:56.390   01:46:56.400  
   and then
  

01:46:56.400   01:46:59.060  
   and then 
   intermediary  

01:46:59.060   01:46:59.070  
  there's there's the the intermediary
  

01:46:59.070   01:47:01.489  
  there's there's the the intermediary
between     that's  

01:47:01.489   01:47:01.499  
between   that and and Christ say that's
  

01:47:01.499   01:47:03.649  
between   that and and Christ say that's
the    and  

01:47:03.649   01:47:03.659  
the   that's that bird and
  

01:47:03.659   01:47:05.299  
the   that's that bird and
that's     spirit     more  

01:47:05.299   01:47:05.309  
that's that's the spirit   a more
  

01:47:05.309   01:47:07.310  
that's that's the spirit   a more
abstracted     that's  

01:47:07.310   01:47:07.320  
abstracted sense and I would say that's
 

01:47:07.320   01:47:09.259  
abstracted sense and I would say that's
probably   ever  

01:47:09.259   01:47:09.269  
probably   Christianity ever
  

01:47:09.269   01:47:11.660  
probably   Christianity ever 
   as  

01:47:11.660   01:47:11.670  
  got to the notion of consciousness as
  

01:47:11.670   01:47:13.939  
  got to the notion of consciousness as
such     consciousness  

01:47:13.939   01:47:13.949  
such you know disembodied consciousness
 

01:47:13.949   01:47:17.060  
such you know disembodied consciousness
something     that    the  

01:47:17.060   01:47:17.070  
something like that   and then there's the
  

01:47:17.070   01:47:19.040  
something like that   and then there's the 
   and  

01:47:19.040   01:47:19.050  
  notion of the suffering individual and
  

01:47:19.050   01:47:21.649  
  notion of the suffering individual and
and     very     complicated  

01:47:21.649   01:47:21.659  
and that's that's a very   complicated
  

01:47:21.659   01:47:25.189  
and that's that's a very   complicated
idea     something     order  

01:47:25.189   01:47:25.199  
   like in order
  

01:47:25.199   01:47:29.089  
   like in order
for     this     and  

01:47:29.089   01:47:29.099  
for so there's this   idea an old idea and
  

01:47:29.099   01:47:30.560  
for so there's this   idea an old idea and
I     Jewish  

01:47:30.560   01:47:30.570  
  I believe this was originally a Jewish
  

01:47:30.570   01:47:32.839  
  I believe this was originally a Jewish
idea    the  

01:47:32.839   01:47:32.849  
idea   with the
  

01:47:32.849   01:47:34.580  
idea   with the
attributes     omniscience  

01:47:34.580   01:47:34.590  
attributes of   God omniscience
  

01:47:34.590   01:47:37.189  
attributes of   God omniscience
omnipresence     lacks  

01:47:37.189   01:47:37.199  
omnipresence and omnipotent   lacks
  

01:47:37.199   01:47:38.600  
omnipresence and omnipotent   lacks
something 

01:47:38.600   01:47:38.610  
something
 

01:47:38.610   01:47:40.250  
something
so     really 

01:47:40.250   01:47:40.260  
so it's like a Zen koan it's a really
 

01:47:40.260   01:47:42.350  
so it's like a Zen koan it's a really
   can  

01:47:42.350   01:47:42.360  
   the world can
  

01:47:42.360   01:47:44.419  
   the world can
something     like     is  

01:47:44.419   01:47:44.429  
something like   that lack and the idea is
  

01:47:44.429   01:47:47.780  
something like   that lack and the idea is 
   that's  

01:47:47.780   01:47:47.790  
   that's
  

01:47:47.790   01:47:49.819  
   that's
everything     that's  

01:47:49.819   01:47:49.829  
everything lacks limitation and that's
 

01:47:49.829   01:47:52.010  
everything lacks limitation and that's

   being able to do
things     partly     gives  

01:48:02.510   01:48:02.520  
things because   because it gives
  

01:48:02.520   01:48:04.189  
things because   because it gives
you     do     that's

you something   I suppose that's
that's     you  

01:48:06.589   01:48:06.599  
that's a big part of it   right is if you
  

01:48:06.599   01:48:08.240  
that's a big part of it   right is if you
had     you     every  

01:48:08.240   01:48:08.250  
had everything   wanted that at every

  that's there's there's nothing there's
no     story     because

no story   because
  

01:48:16.770   01:48:18.169  
no story   because
that     know     the  

01:48:18.169   01:48:18.179  
that happened to Superman   the
  

01:48:18.179   01:48:20.780  
that happened to Superman   the
the     by     he  

01:48:20.780   01:48:20.790  
the cartoon character   the 1980s he
  

01:48:20.790   01:48:22.129  
the cartoon character   the 1980s he
could     and     could  

01:48:22.129   01:48:22.139  
could juggle planets and   you could
  

01:48:22.139   01:48:23.959  
could juggle planets and   you could
bounce     off     and  

01:48:23.959   01:48:23.969  
bounce like   him and
  

01:48:23.969   01:48:25.910  
bounce like   him and
be     fine     bored  

01:48:25.910   01:48:25.920  
be fine   and it's like everyone got bored
  

01:48:25.920   01:48:27.470  
be fine   and it's like everyone got bored 
   to  

01:48:27.470   01:48:27.480  
   we're going to do to
  

01:48:27.480   01:48:29.899  
   we're going to do to
Superman     bomb  

01:48:29.899   01:48:29.909  
Superman like you love a hydrogen bomb
 

01:48:29.909   01:48:31.700  
Superman like you love a hydrogen bomb
   like  

01:48:31.700   01:48:31.710  
  atom and he just brushes it off and like
  

01:48:31.710   01:48:33.169  
  atom and he just brushes it off and like
combs     and     of  

01:48:33.169   01:48:33.179  
combs his hair and   that's the end of
  

01:48:33.179   01:48:34.939  
combs his hair and   that's the end of 
   series  

01:48:34.939   01:48:34.949  
  that and the whole cartoon series
  

01:48:34.949   01:48:38.270  
  that and the whole cartoon series
basically    have  

01:48:38.270   01:48:38.280  
basically   died because he didn't have
  

01:48:38.280   01:48:40.700  
basically   died because he didn't have
any     without     the  

01:48:40.700   01:48:40.710  
   the
  

01:48:40.710   01:48:42.439  
   the
limitation    an  

01:48:42.439   01:48:42.449  
limitation   and I think that's an
  

01:48:42.449   01:48:45.109  
limitation   and I think that's an
absolutely     part  

01:48:45.109   01:48:45.119  
absolutely remarkable   idea and so part
  

01:48:45.119   01:48:48.169  
absolutely remarkable   idea and so part 
   is  

01:48:48.169   01:48:48.179  
  of the notion of Christ and this is
  

01:48:48.179   01:48:49.700  
  of the notion of Christ and this is
something     puzzled     long  

01:48:49.700   01:48:49.710  
   over for a long
  

01:48:49.710   01:48:51.229  
   over for a long
time     a     from  

01:48:51.229   01:48:51.239  
time and I learned a   of this from
  

01:48:51.239   01:48:53.120  
time and I learned a   of this from
young     Christianity  

01:48:53.120   01:48:53.130  
young is   that there's IDN Christianity
  

01:48:53.130   01:48:55.459  
young is   that there's IDN Christianity 
   which  

01:48:55.459   01:48:55.469  
  that there's consciousness as such which
  

01:48:55.469   01:48:57.530  
  that there's consciousness as such which
which     it  

01:48:57.530   01:48:57.540  
which in some sense   is eternal it
  

01:48:57.540   01:48:59.000  
which in some sense   is eternal it
stretches     time  

01:48:59.000   01:48:59.010  
stretches from   the beginning of the time
  

01:48:59.010   01:49:00.649

01:49:00.649   01:49:00.659  
to the   but it's this
  

01:49:00.659   01:49:03.229  
to the   but it's this
abstracted     certain  

01:49:03.229   01:49:03.239  
abstracted notion but it lacks a   certain
  

01:49:03.239   01:49:04.669  
abstracted notion but it lacks a   certain
kind     of     not  

01:49:04.669   01:49:04.679  
kind of   reality because it's not
  

01:49:04.679   01:49:07.069  
kind of   reality because it's not
instantiated     not  

01:49:07.069   01:49:07.079  
instantiated somewhere   not it's not
  

01:49:07.079   01:49:09.470

01:49:09.480   01:49:12.649  
instantiated in a specific   time and

   Trinity
  

01:49:15.090   01:49:16.819  
   Trinity
or     the     Trinity  

01:49:16.819   01:49:16.829  
or one of the   of the Trinity
  

01:49:16.829   01:49:19.359

01:49:19.369   01:49:22.160

consciousness   be

consciousness   be
embedded     time

  embedded in history in a particular time
  

01:49:25.079   01:49:27.560  
  embedded in history in a particular time
in     archetypal  

01:49:27.560   01:49:27.570  
in place   and so there's the archetypal
  

01:49:27.570   01:49:29.299  
in place   and so there's the archetypal
embeddedness     the  

01:49:29.299   01:49:29.309  
embeddedness and that would be the
 

01:49:29.309   01:49:31.250  
embeddedness and that would be the
   man  

01:49:31.250   01:49:31.260  
  Incarnation and that's the perfect man
  

01:49:31.260   01:49:33.799  
  Incarnation and that's the perfect man
right     acts  

01:49:33.799   01:49:33.809  
right who accepts his mortality   and acts
  

01:49:33.809   01:49:36.589  
right who accepts his mortality   and acts 
   it's

a   very strong strain in Christianity I
  

01:49:42.929   01:49:44.510  
a   very strong strain in Christianity I
would     is     in

01:49:52.050   01:49:55.310  
purpose of that   the proper path of life
is     tradition     and  

01:49:55.310   01:49:55.320  
is to take the tradition   let's say and
  

01:49:55.320   01:49:56.930  
is to take the tradition   let's say and
the     that's     with  

01:49:56.930   01:49:56.940  
the spirit that's   associated with
  

01:49:56.940   01:50:00.200  
the spirit that's   associated with
consciousness    out  

01:50:00.200   01:50:00.210  
consciousness   to act it out
  

01:50:00.210   01:50:02.810

in a   to the

manner in which Christ acted   out in his 
   the  

01:50:10.850   01:50:10.860  
  life and what that means in part is the
  

01:50:10.860   01:50:13.490  
  life and what that means in part is the
acceptance     preconditions  

01:50:13.490   01:50:13.500  
acceptance of   the tragic preconditions
  

01:50:13.500   01:50:15.140  
acceptance of   the tragic preconditions
of     partly  

01:50:15.140   01:50:15.150  
of existence and so that's partly
 

01:50:15.150   01:50:18.170  
of existence and so that's partly
betrayal   and  

01:50:18.170   01:50:18.180  
betrayal   right betrayal by friends and
  

01:50:18.180   01:50:20.120  
betrayal   right betrayal by friends and
by     it's  

01:50:20.120   01:50:20.130  
by   family and by the state and it's
  

01:50:20.130   01:50:22.760  
by   family and by the state and it's
partly     you  

01:50:22.760   01:50:22.770  
partly punishment for our   sins that you
  

01:50:22.770   01:50:24.950  
partly punishment for our   sins that you
did     you

that's     very     far

that's a very very   as far
  

01:50:46.200   01:50:48.800  
that's a very very   as far 
   know  

01:50:48.800   01:50:48.810  
   also you know
  

01:50:48.810   01:50:50.750  
   also you know
the     world     seen  

01:50:50.750   01:50:50.760  
the world   is a weird place and I've seen
  

01:50:50.760   01:50:52.550  
the world   is a weird place and I've seen
some     things     and  

01:50:52.550   01:50:52.560  
some   in my life and
  

01:50:52.560   01:50:54.310  
some   in my life and
one     that  

01:50:54.310   01:50:54.320  
one   of the things that I've seen is that
  

01:50:54.320   01:50:56.990  
one   of the things that I've seen is that
you     dealt     who  

01:50:56.990   01:50:57.000  
you know I've dealt   with some people who
  

01:50:57.000   01:50:59.660  
you know I've dealt   with some people who
are    on  

01:50:59.660   01:50:59.670  
are   let's say that they weren't on
  

01:50:59.670   01:51:01.580  
are   let's say that they weren't on
a     path     and  

01:51:01.580   01:51:01.590  
a good path   and
  

01:51:01.590   01:51:02.930  
a good path   and
one     of     really  

01:51:02.930   01:51:02.940  
one of   really
  

01:51:02.940   01:51:04.760  
one of   really 
   people  

01:51:04.760   01:51:04.770  
  interesting about being around people
  

01:51:04.770   01:51:06.050  
  interesting about being around people
like    they  

01:51:06.050   01:51:06.060  
like   like they
  

01:51:06.060   01:51:07.850  
like   like they
were    field  

01:51:07.850   01:51:07.860  
were   gravitational field
  

01:51:07.860   01:51:09.920  
were   gravitational field 
   metaphorically  

01:51:09.920   01:51:09.930  
   I'm speaking metaphorically
  

01:51:09.930   01:51:12.560  
   I'm speaking metaphorically
obviously     so  

01:51:12.560   01:51:12.570  
obviously and their worldview was so
 

01:51:12.570   01:51:14.180  
obviously and their worldview was so

01:51:14.180   01:51:14.190  
  warped and twisted that if you came
  

01:51:14.190   01:51:16.550  
  warped and twisted that if you came

  within contact of them you all of a
  

01:51:16.560   01:51:18.740  
  within contact of them you all of a
sudden     their  

01:51:18.740   01:51:18.750  
sudden started   to play a part in their
  

01:51:18.750   01:51:21.410  
sudden started   to play a part in their
drama    they  

01:51:21.410   01:51:21.420  
drama   and it was almost inevitable they
  

01:51:21.420   01:51:23.750  
drama   and it was almost inevitable they
would     maneuver     and  

01:51:23.750   01:51:23.760  
would maneuver   and manipulate and
  

01:51:23.760   01:51:25.940  
would maneuver   and manipulate and
interpret     into  

01:51:25.940   01:51:25.950  
interpret in a way that made you into
 

01:51:25.950   01:51:27.620  
interpret in a way that made you into
the     matter 

01:51:27.620   01:51:27.630  
the villain in their story no matter
 

01:51:27.630   01:51:29.690  
the villain in their story no matter
what     was    and  

01:51:29.690   01:51:29.700  
what it was   wanted to do and
  

01:51:29.700   01:51:31.610  
what it was   wanted to do and
unless     like  

01:51:31.610   01:51:31.620  
unless you've encountered   something like
  

01:51:31.620   01:51:33.530  
unless you've encountered   something like
that     probably     you  

01:51:33.530   01:51:33.540  
that and many   have you
  

01:51:33.540   01:51:36.230  
that and many   have you
don't     powerful     is  

01:51:36.230   01:51:36.240  
don't know how powerful   is
  

01:51:36.240   01:51:38.150  
don't know how powerful   is
and     it's     that  

01:51:38.150   01:51:38.160  
and so it's   certainly possible that
  

01:51:38.160   01:51:40.940  
and so it's   certainly possible that
someone     like     a  

01:51:40.940   01:51:40.950  
someone can act in   a
  

01:51:40.950   01:51:43.730  
someone can act in   a
gravitational     and     things  

01:51:43.730   01:51:43.740  
gravitational   bend things
  

01:51:43.740   01:51:45.950  
gravitational   bend things
around     narrative  

01:51:45.950   01:51:45.960  
around them   to fit their narrative
  

01:51:45.960   01:51:48.560  
around them   to fit their narrative 
   narratives  

01:51:48.560   01:51:48.570  
  they're unhappy and tragic narratives
  

01:51:48.570   01:51:50.420  
  they're unhappy and tragic narratives
but     the     know  

01:51:50.420   01:51:50.430  
but I've seen the   you know
  

01:51:50.430   01:51:53.690  
but I've seen the   you know
we're     with  

01:51:53.690   01:51:53.700  
  we're people who were aiming upward with

  we're people who were aiming upward with 
   of  

01:51:55.340   01:51:55.350  
   and because of
  

01:51:55.350   01:51:57.170  
   and because of

   around them and and that that
that     around  

01:52:01.310   01:52:01.320  
that that   and that ordered things around
  

01:52:01.320   01:52:03.380  
that that   and that ordered things around
them     I     it's  

01:52:03.380   01:52:03.390  
them in profound   think it's
  

01:52:03.390   01:52:05.710  
them in profound   think it's
an     open     question  

01:52:05.710   01:52:05.720  
an open   question
  

01:52:05.720   01:52:07.960  
an open   question
the     which     would  

01:52:07.960   01:52:07.970  
the degree to   the cosmos would
  

01:52:07.970   01:52:11.010  
the degree to   the cosmos would
order     you  

01:52:11.010   01:52:11.020  
order itself   around you properly if you
  

01:52:11.020   01:52:13.690  
order itself   around you properly if you 
   you  

01:52:13.690   01:52:13.700  
  got yourself together as much as you
  

01:52:13.700   01:52:16.300  
  got yourself together as much as you
could     together     mean

could get yourself   mean
  

01:52:16.310   01:52:18.010  
could get yourself   mean
we     things     very  

01:52:18.010   01:52:18.020  
   can go very very
  

01:52:18.020   01:52:20.320  
   can go very very
badly     very  

01:52:20.320   01:52:20.330  
badly wrong if you if you do things very
 

01:52:20.330   01:52:22.360  
badly wrong if you if you do things very
   that  

01:52:22.360   01:52:22.370  
   about that
  

01:52:22.370   01:52:24.850  
   about that
but     you  

01:52:24.850   01:52:24.860  
but   the converse is also true if you
  

01:52:24.860   01:52:26.710  
but   the converse is also true if you
start     properly     and  

01:52:26.710   01:52:26.720  
start to sort   and
  

01:52:26.720   01:52:28.360

   we're

an     profound    effect  

01:52:53.950   01:52:53.960  
an open question how profound   effect
  

01:52:53.960   01:52:55.360  
an open question how profound   effect
that     of  

01:52:55.360   01:52:55.370  
that   would have on the structure of
  

01:52:55.370   01:52:57.190  
that   would have on the structure of 
   it  

01:52:57.190   01:52:57.200  
  reality if you really chose to act it
  

01:52:57.200   01:52:59.800  
  reality if you really chose to act it
out     things     my  

01:52:59.800   01:52:59.810  
out   as I said in my
  

01:52:59.810   01:53:01.600  
out   as I said in my
life     believe  

01:53:01.600   01:53:01.610  
life that indicate   that I do believe
  

01:53:01.610   01:53:03.340  
life that indicate   that I do believe
there's     life  

01:53:03.340   01:53:03.350  
there's a metaphysical element to life
 

01:53:03.350   01:53:05.380  
there's a metaphysical element to life
as     as    practical  

01:53:05.380   01:53:05.390  
as well as   the rational practical
  

01:53:05.390   01:53:07.180  
as well as   the rational practical
element     when  

01:53:07.180   01:53:07.190  
element and I think there   are times when
  

01:53:07.190   01:53:08.710  
element and I think there   are times when
those     come     I've  

01:53:08.710   01:53:08.720  
those two things   together and I've
  

01:53:08.720   01:53:11.440  
those two things   together and I've
seen    we  

01:53:11.440   01:53:11.450  
seen   and so I don't think we
  

01:53:11.450   01:53:14.470  
seen   and so I don't think we
know    think  

01:53:14.470   01:53:14.480  
know   the limits of virtue I don't think
  

01:53:14.480   01:53:16.720  
know   the limits of virtue I don't think
we     bring  

01:53:16.720   01:53:16.730  
we know what true virtue could bring
 

01:53:16.730   01:53:18.940  
we know what true virtue could bring
about   carefully  

01:53:18.940   01:53:18.950  
about   if we if we aimed at it carefully
  

01:53:18.950   01:53:21.220  
about   if we if we aimed at it carefully 
   that  

01:53:21.220   01:53:21.230  
  and practically and so the notion that
  

01:53:21.230   01:53:22.660  
  and practically and so the notion that
there's     the  

01:53:22.660   01:53:22.670  
there's something divine about the
 

01:53:22.670   01:53:24.910  
there's something divine about the
individual   of  

01:53:24.910   01:53:24.920  
individual   who accepts the conditions of
  

01:53:24.920   01:53:27.010

01:55:48.870   01:55:51.260  
   and he was just on the 
   of  

01:55:51.260   01:55:51.270  
  verge of grasping the essence of
  

01:55:51.270   01:55:52.580  
  verge of grasping the essence of
existence     an  

01:55:52.580   01:55:52.590  
  existence and then he'd have an
  

01:55:52.590   01:55:54.710  
  existence and then he'd have an
epileptic     subjective  

01:55:54.710   01:55:54.720  
epileptic seizure and for the subjective
 

01:55:54.720   01:55:56.960  
epileptic seizure and for the subjective
feeling     knowledge    was  

01:55:56.960   01:55:56.970  
feeling was that that much knowledge   was
  

01:55:56.970   01:55:59.690  
feeling was that that much knowledge   was
just     him     you  

01:55:59.690   01:55:59.700  
just too much   well you
  

01:55:59.700   01:56:00.770  
just too much   well you
know     was     a  

01:56:00.770   01:56:00.780  
know you can say well that was   a
  

01:56:00.780   01:56:03.200  
know you can say well that was   a
neurological     you  

01:56:03.200   01:56:03.210  
neurological abnormality   and fine you
  

01:56:03.210   01:56:05.570  
neurological abnormality   and fine you 
   know  

01:56:05.570   01:56:05.580  
   God he was Dostoyevsky you know
  

01:56:05.580   01:56:10.960  
   God he was Dostoyevsky you know
and     so  

01:56:10.960   01:56:10.970  
 
 

01:56:10.970   01:56:13.580  
 
yeah     the    idea  

01:56:13.580   01:56:13.590  
yeah well so that's the   Trinitarian idea
  

01:56:13.590   01:56:15.890  
yeah well so that's the   Trinitarian idea
fundamentally     notion     is  

01:56:15.890   01:56:15.900  
fundamentally and if this notion   is
  

01:56:15.900   01:56:18.260  
fundamentally and if this notion   is
the     crosses  

01:56:18.260   01:56:18.270  
the   notion that well the crosses crosses
  

01:56:18.270   01:56:20.060  
the   notion that well the crosses crosses 
   marks  

01:56:20.060   01:56:20.070  
  a funny thing because the cross marks
  

01:56:20.070   01:56:21.920  
  a funny thing because the cross marks
the     and  

01:56:21.920   01:56:21.930  
the center you know and it's an X and
 

01:56:21.930   01:56:23.990  
the center you know and it's an X and
the     the    like  

01:56:23.990   01:56:24.000  
the X is the   of the world like
  

01:56:24.000   01:56:26.330

01:56:32.970   01:56:32.980  
the world is a place of   betray
  

01:56:32.980   01:56:34.590  
the world is a place of   betray 
   that's  

01:56:34.590   01:56:34.600  
  no and suffering in limitation that's
  

01:56:34.600   01:56:36.540  
  no and suffering in limitation that's
that's     the  

01:56:36.540   01:56:36.550  
that's exactly   what it is and the
  

01:56:36.550   01:56:38.280  
that's exactly   what it is and the 
   given

that   represents
I     believe     that  

01:56:44.580   01:56:44.590  
I believe   that's coil with that
  

01:56:44.590   01:56:46.650  
I believe   that's coil with that
representation     is     you're  

01:56:46.650   01:56:46.660  
representation implies is   that you're
  

01:56:46.660   01:56:50.010  
representation implies is   that you're 
   and  

01:56:50.010   01:56:50.020  
  supposed to voluntarily accept that and
  

01:56:50.020   01:56:58.680  
  supposed to voluntarily accept that and
then     move     faith  

01:56:58.680   01:56:58.690  
then move   um well in good faith
  

01:56:58.690   01:57:00.540  
then move   um well in good faith
and     courage     and

02:02:27.700   02:02:27.710  
know it's ambivalent in Milton but but
 

02:02:27.710   02:02:29.500  
know it's ambivalent in Milton but but
the     that 

02:02:29.500   02:02:29.510  
the fundamental claim seems to be that
 

02:02:29.510   02:02:30.880  
the fundamental claim seems to be that
the     farther    more  

02:02:30.880   02:02:30.890  
the farther   you get from God the more
  

02:02:30.890   02:02:33.460  
the farther   you get from God the more 
   idea  

02:02:33.460   02:02:33.470  
   and then there's another idea
  

02:02:33.470   02:02:35.860  
   and then there's another idea
that     Satan     the  

02:02:35.860   02:02:35.870  
   who's Lucifer the
  

02:02:35.870   02:02:37.150  
   who's Lucifer the
bringer     of     God's  

02:02:37.150   02:02:37.160  
bringer of   light right he's God's
  

02:02:37.160   02:02:39.460  
bringer of   light right he's God's
highest     kind  

02:02:39.460   02:02:39.470  
highest   angel gone most wrong and I kind
  

02:02:39.470   02:02:40.870  
highest   angel gone most wrong and I kind
of     think     of  

02:02:40.870   02:02:40.880  
of think   of
  

02:02:40.880   02:02:43.750  
of think   of
rationality    not  

02:02:43.750   02:02:43.760  
rationality   of intelligence it's not
  

02:02:43.760   02:02:45.070  
rationality   of intelligence it's not
because     I'm     of  

02:02:45.070   02:02:45.080  
because I'm   of
  

02:02:45.080   02:02:46.330  
because I'm   of
intelligence     hurray     for

intelligence because   for
  

02:02:46.340   02:02:48.370  
intelligence because   for
intelligence     that  

02:02:48.370   02:02:48.380  
  intelligence but one of the things that
  

02:02:48.380   02:02:50.800  
  intelligence but one of the things that 
   before  

02:02:50.800   02:02:50.810  
   onto before
  

02:02:50.810   02:02:52.630  
   onto before
the     totalitarian     States  

02:02:52.630   02:02:52.640  
the rise of modern totalitarian   States
  

02:02:52.640   02:02:56.440  
the rise of modern totalitarian   States
was    to  

02:02:56.440   02:02:56.450  
was   that intellect has the capacity to
  

02:02:56.450   02:02:58.510  
was   that intellect has the capacity to
fall     and  

02:02:58.510   02:02:58.520  
fall in love with its own creations   and
  

02:02:58.520   02:03:00.460  
fall in love with its own creations   and
to     them     place  

02:03:00.460   02:03:00.470  
to   the highest place
  

02:03:00.470   02:03:03.070  
to   the highest place
which     claim  

02:03:03.070   02:03:03.080  
which is basically a totalitarian claim
 

02:03:03.080   02:03:05.140  
which is basically a totalitarian claim
it's     that 

02:03:05.140   02:03:05.150  
it's like what I know is everything that
 

02:03:05.150   02:03:07.120  
it's like what I know is everything that
   only  

02:03:07.120   02:03:07.130  
   be known and if it was only
  

02:03:07.130   02:03:08.590  
   be known and if it was only
manifest     would  

02:03:08.590   02:03:08.600  
manifest in the   world the world would
  

02:03:08.600   02:03:10.690  
manifest in the   world the world would
become     that  

02:03:10.690   02:03:10.700  
become   a utopia and I also think that
  

02:03:10.700   02:03:12.670  
become   a utopia and I also think that
we'll     talk     also  

02:03:12.670   02:03:12.680  
we'll talk   week I also
  

02:03:12.680   02:03:14.440  
we'll talk   week I also 
   behind  

02:03:14.440   02:03:14.450  
   behind
  

02:03:14.450   02:03:16.750  
   behind
the    of  

02:03:16.750   02:03:16.760  
the   Tower of Babel remember the Tower of
  

02:03:16.760   02:03:18.640  
the   Tower of Babel remember the Tower of
Babel     human     that  

02:03:18.640   02:03:18.650  
Babel is raised by human   beings so that
  

02:03:18.650   02:03:20.890  
Babel is raised by human   beings so that
the     heaven     it's  

02:03:20.890   02:03:20.900  
the pinnacle will hit heaven   and so it's
  

02:03:20.900   02:03:22.360  
the pinnacle will hit heaven   and so it's
the     structure  

02:03:22.360   02:03:22.370  
the idea that   we can build a structure
  

02:03:22.370   02:03:25.750  
the idea that   we can build a structure 
   unnecessary  

02:03:25.750   02:03:25.760  
  that makes the transcendent unnecessary
  

02:03:25.760   02:03:28.300  
  that makes the transcendent unnecessary
and     ok     things  

02:03:28.300   02:03:28.310  
and so   so there's those two things
  

02:03:28.310   02:03:30.640  
and so   so there's those two things
then     free  

02:03:30.640   02:03:30.650  
then there's there's an idea of free
 

02:03:30.650   02:03:32.410  
then there's there's an idea of free
   and  

02:03:32.410   02:03:32.420  
  will that's associated with it too and
  

02:03:32.420   02:03:34.690  
  will that's associated with it too and
it     seems     there  

02:03:34.690   02:03:34.700  
it seems   for there
  

02:03:34.700   02:03:38.010  
it seems   for there
to     so     I  

02:03:38.010   02:03:38.020  
to be good there has to be evil   I
  

02:03:38.020   02:03:40.620  
to be good there has to be evil   I 
   like  

02:03:40.620   02:03:40.630  
  I think the answer is something like
  

02:03:40.630   02:03:43.500  
  I think the answer is something like
this     for     be  

02:03:43.500   02:03:43.510  
this is that in order   there to be
  

02:03:43.510   02:03:45.420  
this is that in order   there to be
being     in  

02:03:45.420   02:03:45.430  
being there has to be limitation in
 

02:03:45.430   02:03:47.400  
being there has to be limitation in
order     for    there  

02:03:47.400   02:03:47.410  
order for   their good to be good there
  

02:03:47.410   02:03:49.490  
order for   their good to be good there
has     to     I  

02:03:49.490   02:03:49.500  
has to   I
  

02:03:49.500   02:03:53.520  
has to   I
think     exist     such  

02:03:53.520   02:03:53.530  
think the right path is to exist   such
  

02:03:53.530   02:03:55.380  
think the right path is to exist   such
that     remains  

02:03:55.380   02:03:55.390  
that   the possibility of evil remains
  

02:03:55.390   02:03:57.630  
that   the possibility of evil remains
open     that     I  

02:03:57.630   02:03:57.640  
open   the good and I
  

02:03:57.640   02:03:59.430  
open   the good and I
don't     think     built  

02:03:59.430   02:03:59.440  
don't   evil per se is built
  

02:03:59.440   02:04:01.380  
don't   evil per se is built 
   do  

02:04:01.380   02:04:01.390  
   I do
  

02:04:01.390   02:04:03.510  
   I do
think     that  

02:04:03.510   02:04:03.520  
think that that's human   I think that
  

02:04:03.520   02:04:05.220  
think that that's human   I think that
evil     and     it's  

02:04:05.220   02:04:05.230  
evil is human and   I think it's
  

02:04:05.230   02:04:06.180  
evil is human and   I think it's 
  understandable 

02:04:06.180   02:04:06.190  
  understandable
  

02:04:06.190   02:04:08.460  
  understandable
I     online     the  

02:04:08.460   02:04:08.470  
I did a   about the
  

02:04:08.470   02:04:11.750  
I did a   about the
distinction     and  

02:04:11.750   02:04:11.760  
distinction between evil and tragedy   and
  

02:04:11.760   02:04:13.740  
distinction between evil and tragedy   and
tragedy     the  

02:04:13.740   02:04:13.750  
tragedy seems   to be built into the
  

02:04:13.750   02:04:15.030  
tragedy seems   to be built into the
structure    you  

02:04:15.030   02:04:15.040  
   perhaps you
  

02:04:15.040   02:04:16.800  
   perhaps you 
   doesn't  

02:04:16.800   02:04:16.810  
   doesn't
  

02:04:16.810   02:04:17.970  
   doesn't 
   that  

02:04:17.970   02:04:17.980  
  seem to me that it's your fault that
  

02:04:17.980   02:04:20.730  
  seem to me that it's your fault that 
   it  

02:04:20.730   02:04:20.740  
  there earthquakes for example but but it
  

02:04:20.740   02:04:22.410  
  there earthquakes for example but but it
is     to     that  

02:04:22.410   02:04:22.420  
is all not obvious to   me either that
  

02:04:22.420   02:04:24.480  
is all not obvious to   me either that 
   out  

02:04:24.480   02:04:24.490  
  it's tragedy that takes the spirit out
  

02:04:24.490   02:04:26.610  
  it's tragedy that takes the spirit out 
   are  

02:04:26.610   02:04:26.620  
   beings are
  

02:04:26.620   02:04:28.140  
   beings are
actually     with     tragedy  

02:04:28.140   02:04:28.150  
actually   tragedy
  

02:04:28.150   02:04:29.370  
actually   tragedy
but     equipped     with  

02:04:29.370   02:04:29.380  
but we're not equipped   to deal with
  

02:04:29.380   02:04:32.730  
but we're not equipped   to deal with
malevolence     so  

02:04:32.730   02:04:32.740  
malevolence   that destroys people and so
  

02:04:32.740   02:04:38.100  
malevolence   that destroys people and so
I     think     metaphysically  

02:04:38.100   02:04:38.110  
I think that   metaphysically
  

02:04:38.110   02:04:40.230  
I think that   metaphysically
speaking     structured     that  

02:04:40.230   02:04:40.240  
speaking the world is structured   so that
  

02:04:40.240   02:04:42.690  
speaking the world is structured   so that
people     and  

02:04:42.690   02:04:42.700  
people have a choice between good and
 

02:04:42.700   02:04:45.390  
people have a choice between good and
evil   question  

02:04:45.390   02:04:45.400  
evil   question
  

02:04:45.400   02:04:47.660  
evil   question
is     that  

02:04:47.660   02:04:47.670  
is why do   we have a choice and that
  

02:04:47.670   02:04:51.060  
is why do   we have a choice and that 
   I  

02:04:51.060   02:04:51.070  
   out I
  

02:04:51.070   02:04:54.270  
   out I
don't    for  

02:04:54.270   02:04:54.280  
don't   don't like the alchemists for
  

02:04:54.280   02:04:56.280  
don't   don't like the alchemists for
example     the  

02:04:56.280   02:04:56.290  
example speculated that   and then the
  

02:04:56.290   02:04:58.410  
example speculated that   and then the
Orthodox     also     this  

02:04:58.410   02:04:58.420  
Orthodox Christians also   followed this
  

02:04:58.420   02:05:00.270  
Orthodox Christians also   followed this
line     human     beings  

02:05:00.270   02:05:00.280  
line of reasoning is that human   beings
  

02:05:00.280   02:05:02.970  
line of reasoning is that human   beings
in     by  

02:05:02.970   02:05:02.980  
in some sense   are furthering creation by
  

02:05:02.980   02:05:05.520  
in some sense   are furthering creation by
our     our     I  

02:05:05.520   02:05:05.530  
our actions and by our   and I
  

02:05:05.530   02:05:07.020  
our actions and by our   and I
think    it's  

02:05:07.020   02:05:07.030  
think   that it's
  

02:05:07.030   02:05:09.690  
think   that it's
like     unfinished     in  

02:05:09.690   02:05:09.700  
like it's like creation is unfinished   in
  

02:05:09.700   02:05:11.100  
like it's like creation is unfinished   in
some     participating  

02:05:11.100   02:05:11.110  
some sense and that   we're participating
  

02:05:11.110   02:05:13.710  
some sense and that   we're participating 
   we  

02:05:13.710   02:05:13.720  
   we
  

02:05:13.720   02:05:15.720  
   we
it     part  

02:05:15.720   02:05:15.730  
it is that we want   to move it and part
  

02:05:15.730   02:05:17.040  
it is that we want   to move it and part 
   and  

02:05:17.040   02:05:17.050  
   and
  

02:05:17.050   02:05:18.690  
   and 
   choice  

02:05:18.690   02:05:18.700  
  part of that is that we have the choice
  

02:05:18.700   02:05:20.670  
  part of that is that we have the choice
between     and     also  

02:05:20.670   02:05:20.680  
between   evil and that's also
  

02:05:20.680   02:05:23.070  
between   evil and that's also 
   the  

02:05:23.070   02:05:23.080  
  it's all associated with with the

02:05:31.540   02:05:34.020  
   of responsibility 
   an

  that people feel existentially is an
  

02:05:34.030   02:05:37.770  
  that people feel existentially is an
indication     the  

02:05:37.770   02:05:37.780  
indication of   that so that's about the
  

02:05:37.780   02:05:39.630  
indication of   that so that's about the
best     it  

02:05:39.630   02:05:39.640  
best I could do with that   so and it
  

02:05:39.640   02:05:40.980  
best I could do with that   so and it
seems     it's  

02:05:40.980   02:05:40.990  
seems the way you're   describing it it's
  

02:05:40.990   02:05:43.230  
seems the way you're   describing it it's
built     you  

02:05:43.230   02:05:43.240  
built into at least the   text that you
  

02:05:43.240   02:05:44.880  
built into at least the   text that you
presented    other  

02:05:44.880   02:05:44.890  
presented   the other
  

02:05:44.890   02:05:46.770  
presented   the other
things     God  

02:05:46.770   02:05:46.780  
things I had noticed was God
 

02:05:46.780   02:05:48.630  
things I had noticed was God
consistently     good 

02:05:48.630   02:05:48.640  
consistently describes creation as good
 

02:05:48.640   02:05:50.220  
consistently describes creation as good
   he  

02:05:50.220   02:05:50.230

  laughter he creates things in ounces
  

02:05:54.750   02:05:56.840  
  laughter he creates things in ounces
that     and  

02:05:56.840   02:05:56.850  
that he creates man and woman and
 

02:05:56.850   02:05:58.370  
that he creates man and woman and
announces     that    ya  

02:05:58.370   02:05:58.380  
announces that   ya
  

02:05:58.380   02:06:00.140

over those things   and can use them yeah
and     the  

02:06:01.430   02:06:01.440  
  and it might be something lost the
  

02:06:01.440   02:06:03.140  
  and it might be something lost the
translation     as  

02:06:03.140   02:06:03.150  
translation   but that is described as
  

02:06:03.150   02:06:05.690  
translation   but that is described as
very     that     is  

02:06:05.690   02:06:05.700  
very   Dominion is
  

02:06:05.700   02:06:07.880  
very   Dominion is
brought     speak  

02:06:07.880   02:06:07.890  
brought into   it yes yeah it might speak
  

02:06:07.890   02:06:09.830  
brought into   it yes yeah it might speak
to    great  

02:06:09.830   02:06:09.840  
to   that notion of furthering yeah great
  

02:06:09.840   02:06:11.960  
to   that notion of furthering yeah great
and    and  

02:06:11.960   02:06:11.970  
and   here's something interesting too and
  

02:06:11.970   02:06:13.910  
and   here's something interesting too and 
   see  

02:06:13.910   02:06:13.920  
   you see
  

02:06:13.920   02:06:16.880  
   you see 
   fruit  

02:06:16.880   02:06:16.890  
   eat the fruit
  

02:06:16.890   02:06:18.590  
   eat the fruit
the     first  

02:06:18.590   02:06:18.600  
the snake gives them the fruit the first
 

02:06:18.600   02:06:19.730  
the snake gives them the fruit the first
thing   are  

02:06:19.730   02:06:19.740  
thing   that happens is their eyes are
  

02:06:19.740   02:06:21.740  
thing   that happens is their eyes are
opened    that  

02:06:21.740   02:06:21.750  
opened   that
  

02:06:21.750   02:06:24.860  
opened   that
while     right     there's  

02:06:24.860   02:06:24.870  
while they've woken up   there's
  

02:06:24.870   02:06:26.240  
while they've woken up   there's
been    consciousness  

02:06:26.240   02:06:26.250  
been   an increment in their consciousness
  

02:06:26.250   02:06:27.920  
been   an increment in their consciousness 
   that  

02:06:27.920   02:06:27.930  
   that
  

02:06:27.930   02:06:30.050  
   that
they     that     okay  

02:06:30.050   02:06:30.060  
they recognize   okay
  

02:06:30.060   02:06:31.850  
they recognize   okay 
   to  

02:06:31.850   02:06:31.860  
   is to
  

02:06:31.860   02:06:33.200  
   is to
recognize     you're     and  

02:06:33.200   02:06:33.210  
recognize that   vulnerable and
  

02:06:33.210   02:06:35.180  
recognize that   vulnerable and 
   it  

02:06:35.180   02:06:35.190  
   creatures it
  

02:06:35.190   02:06:37.310  
   creatures it
because    and  

02:06:37.310   02:06:37.320  
because   most animals are like this and
  

02:06:37.320   02:06:39.200  
because   most animals are like this and
they're     protected     our  

02:06:39.200   02:06:39.210  
they're protected   but not us like our
  

02:06:39.210   02:06:42.020  
they're protected   but not us like our
most     vulnerable     for  

02:06:42.020   02:06:42.030  
most vulnerable   parts are displayed for
  

02:06:42.030   02:06:43.940  
most vulnerable   parts are displayed for
harm     right  

02:06:43.940   02:06:43.950  
harm and for everyone   to observe right
  

02:06:43.950   02:06:47.230  
harm and for everyone   to observe right
so     got     bipedal  

02:06:47.230   02:06:47.240  
so we've got   that sort of bipedal
  

02:06:47.240   02:06:49.550  
so we've got   that sort of bipedal 
   but  

02:06:49.550   02:06:49.560  
   us but
  

02:06:49.560   02:06:50.960  
   us but
what's     when  

02:06:50.960   02:06:50.970  
what's really interesting   is that when
  

02:06:50.970   02:06:52.400  
what's really interesting   is that when
Adam     and     naked  

02:06:52.400   02:06:52.410  
Adam and   Eve realized that they're naked
  

02:06:52.410   02:06:55.100  
Adam and   Eve realized that they're naked
it's     that     the  

02:06:55.100   02:06:55.110  
it's the same   they know the
  

02:06:55.110   02:06:56.570  
it's the same   they know the
difference     between     and  

02:06:56.570   02:06:56.580  
difference   and
  

02:06:56.580   02:06:59.690  
difference   and
that     our     just  

02:06:59.690   02:06:59.700  
that   just I just
  

02:06:59.700   02:07:02.030  
that   just I just
ground     trust     so  

02:07:02.030   02:07:02.040  
ground away   so
  

02:07:02.040   02:07:03.530  
ground away   so
what     hell's     here  

02:07:03.530   02:07:03.540  
what the   what's going on here
  

02:07:03.540   02:07:04.540  
what the   what's going on here
what's     between  

02:07:04.540   02:07:04.550  
what's the relationship between
 

02:07:04.550   02:07:07.370  
what's the relationship between
   and  

02:07:07.370   02:07:07.380  
  consciousness knowledge of nakedness and
  

02:07:07.380   02:07:09.110  
  consciousness knowledge of nakedness and
the     then  

02:07:09.110   02:07:09.120  
the   knowledge of good and evil and then
  

02:07:09.120   02:07:11.180  
the   knowledge of good and evil and then
I     I     think  

02:07:11.180   02:07:11.190  
I think   think
  

02:07:11.190   02:07:14.150  
I think   think
I     you  

02:07:14.150   02:07:14.160  
  I think it was that you see when you
  

02:07:14.160   02:07:16.370  
  I think it was that you see when you
know     they  

02:07:16.370   02:07:16.380  
know   that you're vulnerable and they
  

02:07:16.380   02:07:18.680  
know   that you're vulnerable and they
also     death     so  

02:07:18.680   02:07:18.690  
also develop knowledge   so
  

02:07:18.690   02:07:20.690  
also develop knowledge   so
there's     vulnerability  

02:07:20.690   02:07:20.700  
there's deep knowledge of vulnerability
 

02:07:20.700   02:07:21.890  
there's deep knowledge of vulnerability
   they  

02:07:21.890   02:07:21.900  
  and they get embarrassed about that they
  

02:07:21.900   02:07:23.270  
  and they get embarrassed about that they
cover     that's  

02:07:23.270   02:07:23.280  
cover themselves up right so that's
 

02:07:23.280   02:07:25.520  
cover themselves up right so that's
culture     shock 

02:07:25.520   02:07:25.530  
culture so it's a very profound shock
 

02:07:25.530   02:07:27.500  
culture so it's a very profound shock
   naked  

02:07:27.500   02:07:27.510  
   recognize that they're naked
  

02:07:27.510   02:07:29.840  
   recognize that they're naked 
   many  

02:07:29.840   02:07:29.850  
   many
  

02:07:29.850   02:07:31.070  
   many
developed     the     evil  

02:07:31.070   02:07:31.080  
   knowledge of good and evil
  

02:07:31.080   02:07:33.740  
   knowledge of good and evil 
   human  

02:07:33.740   02:07:33.750  
  well I think it's because you see human
  

02:07:33.750   02:07:36.350  
  well I think it's because you see human 
   that  

02:07:36.350   02:07:36.360  
   this peculiar capacity that
  

02:07:36.360   02:07:38.000  
   this peculiar capacity that
no     which     know  

02:07:38.000   02:07:38.010  
no other creature has which   know
  

02:07:38.010   02:07:40.490  
no other creature has which   know
how     be     of  

02:07:40.490   02:07:40.500  
how I can   hurt because I'm aware of
  

02:07:40.500   02:07:42.950  
how I can   hurt because I'm aware of 
   and  

02:07:42.950   02:07:42.960  
   and
  

02:07:42.960   02:07:45.410  
   and
now     I     I  

02:07:45.410   02:07:45.420  
now   I
  

02:07:45.420   02:07:48.140  
now   I
know     you     take  

02:07:48.140   02:07:48.150  
know how you   can be hurt and I can take
  

02:07:48.150   02:07:50.360  
know how you   can be hurt and I can take 
   how  

02:07:50.360   02:07:50.370  
   I think how
  

02:07:50.370   02:07:52.280  
   I think how
evil     it  

02:07:52.280   02:07:52.290  
evil enters the   world that's what it
  

02:07:52.290   02:07:54.020  
evil enters the   world that's what it
looks     to     this  

02:07:54.020   02:07:54.030  
looks like to   this
  

02:07:54.030   02:07:55.670  
looks like to   this
expansion     in  

02:07:55.670   02:07:55.680  
  expansion of knowledge it says in
  

02:07:55.680   02:07:58.010  
  expansion of knowledge it says in
Genesis     people  

02:07:58.010   02:07:58.020  
Genesis that that that gives people
 

02:07:58.020   02:07:59.990  
Genesis that that that gives people
another   knowing  

02:07:59.990   02:08:00.000  
another   attribute of divinity knowing
  

02:08:00.000   02:08:01.970  
another   attribute of divinity knowing
the     difference     it  

02:08:01.970   02:08:01.980  
the   between good and evil it
  

02:08:01.980   02:08:03.670  
the   between good and evil it
has    and  

02:08:03.670   02:08:03.680  
has   nothing to do with animals and
  

02:08:03.680   02:08:05.680  
has   nothing to do with animals and
nothing     prior     to  

02:08:05.680   02:08:05.690  
nothing to do with Adam and   to
  

02:08:05.690   02:08:07.600  
nothing to do with Adam and   to
having    the  

02:08:07.600   02:08:07.610  
having   your eyes open but that the
  

02:08:07.610   02:08:09.250  
having   your eyes open but that the
cosmos     self  

02:08:09.250   02:08:09.260  
cosmos switches when that   self
  

02:08:09.260   02:08:11.260  
cosmos switches when that   self 
   and  

02:08:11.260   02:08:11.270  
   itself and
  

02:08:11.270   02:08:13.360  
   itself and
that's     the     evil  

02:08:13.360   02:08:13.370  
that's when the   possibility of evil
  

02:08:13.370   02:08:14.950  
that's when the   possibility of evil
enters     world     like  

02:08:14.950   02:08:14.960  
enters the world   like
  

02:08:14.960   02:08:17.130  
enters the world   like 
   the  

02:08:17.130   02:08:17.140  
  that and that's also echoed by the
  

02:08:17.140   02:08:19.480  
  that and that's also echoed by the
intimate     relationship     snake  

02:08:19.480   02:08:19.490  
intimate relationship   between the snake
  

02:08:19.490   02:08:21.850  
intimate relationship   between the snake

we're going to because   that's what
  

02:08:23.600   02:08:25.840  
we're going to because   that's what
that's     like  

02:08:25.840   02:08:25.850  
  that's a very strange associations like
  

02:08:25.850   02:08:28.900  
  that's a very strange associations like
this     of  

02:08:28.900   02:08:28.910  
this snake also   becomes the adversary of
  

02:08:28.910   02:08:31.840  
this snake also   becomes the adversary of
being     I     very

   that's  

02:08:33.280   02:08:33.290  
   that's
  

02:08:33.290   02:08:35.680  
   that's 
   that  

02:08:35.680   02:08:35.690  
   that
  

02:08:35.690   02:08:37.720  
   that

the snake that   lives in your enemy and
then     in

02:08:46.600   02:08:46.610  
enemy to the   Netherlands and then
  

02:08:46.610   02:08:48.730  
enemy to the   Netherlands and then
there's     if  

02:08:48.730   02:08:48.740  
  there's the snake that lives in you if
  

02:08:48.740   02:08:52.030

  that snake that's in you right that's
  

02:08:53.870   02:08:55.270  
  that snake that's in you right that's
that's     psychological  

02:08:55.270   02:08:55.280  
that's a   that's a psychological
  

02:08:55.280   02:08:57.930  
that's a   that's a psychological 
   to  

02:08:57.930   02:08:57.940  
  phenomena that's equivalent to
  

02:08:57.940   02:09:00.190  
  phenomena that's equivalent to
transcendent     that  

02:09:00.190   02:09:00.200  
transcendent evil   itself the thing that
  

02:09:00.200   02:09:02.260  
transcendent evil   itself the thing that
inhabits    why

02:09:02.270   02:09:03.730  
inhabits   every single person that's why
there's     the  

02:09:03.730   02:09:03.740  
there's that association between the
 

02:09:03.740   02:09:05.830  
there's that association between the
snake     I    think  

02:09:05.830   02:09:05.840  
snake and Satan and that's why I   think
  

02:09:05.840   02:09:08.410  
snake and Satan and that's why I   think
that     people     associated  

02:09:08.410   02:09:08.420  
   have this it's associated
  

02:09:08.420   02:09:10.120  
   have this it's associated

   is yes
  

02:09:59.870   02:10:01.810  
   is yes
because     quite  

02:10:01.810   02:10:01.820  
because   I've seen people react quite
  

02:10:01.820   02:10:04.450  
because   I've seen people react quite
heroically     of

thank     hi     when  

02:10:57.250   02:10:57.260  
thank you hi   doctor you'd said the when
  

02:10:57.260   02:11:00.250  
thank you hi   doctor you'd said the when
God     it     that  

02:11:00.250   02:11:00.260  
God saw that it   that
  

02:11:00.260   02:11:02.589  
God saw that it   that
as     be     better  

02:11:02.589   02:11:02.599  
as potentially well I might be   better
  

02:11:02.599   02:11:03.510  
as potentially well I might be   better 
   nothing  

02:11:03.510   02:11:03.520  
  than nothing
  

02:11:03.520   02:11:07.390  
  than nothing
and     bracketed  

02:11:07.390   02:11:07.400  
  and the story in Genesis it's bracketed
  

02:11:07.400   02:11:09.220  
  and the story in Genesis it's bracketed
by     literal  

02:11:09.220   02:11:09.230  
by days which aren't   necessarily literal
  

02:11:09.230   02:11:11.140  
by days which aren't   necessarily literal
days     word     know  

02:11:11.140   02:11:11.150  
days young the original word   you know
  

02:11:11.150   02:11:14.859  
days young the original word   you know
but     it  

02:11:14.859   02:11:14.869  
but it's also bracketed by and he saw it
 

02:11:14.869   02:11:16.540  
but it's also bracketed by and he saw it
was     you    day  

02:11:16.540   02:11:16.550  
was good you   know at the end of the day
  

02:11:16.550   02:11:19.359  
was good you   know at the end of the day
so     something  

02:11:19.359   02:11:19.369  
so my question is is there   something
  

02:11:19.369   02:11:21.089  
so my question is is there   something 
   between  

02:11:21.089   02:11:21.099  
  more profoundly happening there between
  

02:11:21.099   02:11:23.589  
  more profoundly happening there between
this     into  

02:11:23.589   02:11:23.599  
this profundity   of speaking into
  

02:11:23.599   02:11:26.140  
this profundity   of speaking into 
   is  

02:11:26.140   02:11:26.150  
  existence the way you know the start is
  

02:11:26.150   02:11:29.890  
  existence the way you know the start is 
   it's  

02:11:29.890   02:11:29.900  
   the seeing that it's
  

02:11:29.900   02:11:32.620  
   the seeing that it's
good     is     modeling  

02:11:32.620   02:11:32.630  
good   modeling
  

02:11:32.630   02:11:34.299  
good   modeling
consciousness     little     more  

02:11:34.299   02:11:34.309  
consciousness is there a little   more
  

02:11:34.309   02:11:38.859  
consciousness is there a little   more
there     so  

02:11:38.859   02:11:38.869  
there for   us to grapple with okay so so
  

02:11:38.869   02:11:41.640  
there for   us to grapple with okay so so 
   way  

02:11:41.640   02:11:41.650  
   grapple with in what way
  

02:11:41.650   02:11:46.330  
   grapple with in what way
in     amazing  

02:11:46.330   02:11:46.340  
in the sense that we have this amazing
 

02:11:46.340   02:11:49.709  
in the sense that we have this amazing
   forth  

02:11:49.709   02:11:49.719  
  this insight of speaking things forth
  

02:11:49.719   02:11:52.180  
  this insight of speaking things forth
but     consciousness  

02:11:52.180   02:11:52.190  
but you'd also   comment on consciousness
  

02:11:52.190   02:11:54.970  
but you'd also   comment on consciousness
as     until  

02:11:54.970   02:11:54.980  
as until   something's observed or until
  

02:11:54.980   02:11:57.850  
as until   something's observed or until
so     God  

02:11:57.850   02:11:57.860  
so there until it's seen so when God
 

02:11:57.860   02:12:02.379  
so there until it's seen so when God
sees     that    is  

02:12:02.379   02:12:02.389  
sees that   was good is
  

02:12:02.389   02:12:04.330  
sees that   was good is
there     bracketing  

02:12:04.330   02:12:04.340  
there   there's kind of this bracketing
  

02:12:04.340   02:12:07.240  
there   there's kind of this bracketing
between     the  

02:12:07.240   02:12:07.250  
between the bringing   forth through the
  

02:12:07.250   02:12:08.379  
between the bringing   forth through the
spoke     word  

02:12:08.379   02:12:08.389  
spoke we you know through the word
 

02:12:08.389   02:12:10.209  
spoke we you know through the word
through     good    I  

02:12:10.209   02:12:10.219  
through Jesus okay okay that's good   I
  

02:12:10.219   02:12:12.160  
through Jesus okay okay that's good   I
see     mean     I  

02:12:12.160   02:12:12.170  
see what you mean   okay well I think I
  

02:12:12.170   02:12:15.459  
see what you mean   okay well I think I 
   okay  

02:12:15.459   02:12:15.469  
  think what that is is that I think okay
  

02:12:15.469   02:12:18.970  
  think what that is is that I think okay
so     an  

02:12:18.970   02:12:18.980  
  so it's perfectly reasonable from an
  

02:12:18.980   02:12:21.339  
  so it's perfectly reasonable from an
archetypal     perspective  

02:12:21.339   02:12:21.349  
archetypal and psychological perspective
 

02:12:21.349   02:12:23.799  
archetypal and psychological perspective
to   word  

02:12:23.799   02:12:23.809  
to   of the word
  

02:12:23.809   02:12:25.990  
to   of the word
equivalent     truth  

02:12:25.990   02:12:26.000  
equivalent   to the spoken truth
  

02:12:26.000   02:12:27.970  
equivalent   to the spoken truth
I     mean     New  

02:12:27.970   02:12:27.980  
I mean   price makes that claim in the New
  

02:12:27.980   02:12:30.159  
I mean   price makes that claim in the New 
   right  

02:12:30.159   02:12:30.169  
   right
  

02:12:30.169   02:12:32.830  
   right
and     can  

02:12:32.830   02:12:32.840  
and embodied and so then you can
 

02:12:32.840   02:12:34.929  
and embodied and so then you can
logically   the  

02:12:34.929   02:12:34.939  
logically   the
  

02:12:34.939   02:12:37.389  
logically   the
idea    into  

02:12:37.389   02:12:37.399  
idea   if things are spoken into
  

02:12:37.399   02:12:39.250  
idea   if things are spoken into
being     good  

02:12:39.250   02:12:39.260  
  being through truth then they're good
  

02:12:39.260   02:12:41.259  
  being through truth then they're good 
   that  

02:12:41.259   02:12:41.269  
   that
  

02:12:41.269   02:12:43.509  
   that
association     that  

02:12:43.509   02:12:43.519  
  association exists and I think that
  

02:12:43.519   02:12:45.609  
  association exists and I think that 
   that's  

02:12:45.609   02:12:45.619  
  that's well I also think that that's
  

02:12:45.619   02:12:47.469  
  that's well I also think that that's
that's     deepest  

02:12:47.469   02:12:47.479  
  that's that in some sense the deepest
  

02:12:47.479   02:12:49.870  
  that's that in some sense the deepest
claim     I  

02:12:49.870   02:12:49.880  
claim of faith I   believe that because I
  

02:12:49.880   02:12:51.639  
claim of faith I   believe that because I
think     a  

02:12:51.639   02:12:51.649  
think   that I think you have to make a
  

02:12:51.649   02:12:53.529  
think   that I think you have to make a
decision     your     can  

02:12:53.529   02:12:53.539  
decision   as I can
  

02:12:53.539   02:12:55.149  
decision   as I can
tell     and     this  

02:12:55.149   02:12:55.159  
tell and   I think Kierkegaard knew this
  

02:12:55.159   02:12:56.830  
tell and   I think Kierkegaard knew this 
   ever  

02:12:56.830   02:12:56.840  
   ever
  

02:12:56.840   02:13:02.229  
   ever
read     good  

02:13:02.229   02:13:02.239  
read   and that is that if being is good
  

02:13:02.239   02:13:05.649  
read   and that is that if being is good 
   being  

02:13:05.649   02:13:05.659  
  then an honest relationship with being
  

02:13:05.659   02:13:07.989  
  then an honest relationship with being 
   have  

02:13:07.989   02:13:07.999  
   and then if you have
  

02:13:07.999   02:13:09.520  
   and then if you have
an     then  

02:13:09.520   02:13:09.530  
an honest relationship   with being then
  

02:13:09.530   02:13:11.709  
an honest relationship   with being then
you're     speak     then  

02:13:11.709   02:13:11.719  
you're going   and then
  

02:13:11.719   02:13:14.439  
you're going   and then
I     have     that  

02:13:14.439   02:13:14.449  
I think what you have   is that
  

02:13:14.449   02:13:16.989  
I think what you have   is that
speaking    then

speaking   if you speak the truth then
what     what  

02:13:20.350   02:13:20.360  
what happens is good regardless   of what
  

02:13:20.360   02:13:22.779  
what happens is good regardless   of what
happens    the  

02:13:22.779   02:13:22.789  
happens   that's the
  

02:13:22.789   02:13:23.979  
happens   that's the
rub     of     that's  

02:13:23.979   02:13:23.989  
rub of   that's
  

02:13:23.989   02:13:25.029  
rub of   that's
something     could     guard  

02:13:25.029   02:13:25.039  
   guard

wrestled     I'm  

02:13:31.239   02:13:31.249  
wrestled with you know   and I mean I'm

   anything
and     and     it's  

02:13:38.649   02:13:38.659  
   quickly well I guess it's
  

02:13:38.659   02:13:42.429  
   quickly well I guess it's 
   you  

02:13:42.429   02:13:42.439  
   partly because you
  

02:13:42.439   02:13:44.319

a   get what you want but the
  

02:13:50.090   02:13:51.520  
a   get what you want but the
problem     with     assumes  

02:13:51.520   02:13:51.530  
problem with   that is that that assumes
  

02:13:51.530   02:13:53.169  
problem with   that is that that assumes
that     want     that  

02:13:53.169   02:13:53.179  
that you   and that
  

02:13:53.179   02:13:55.569  
that you   and that 
   problem  

02:13:55.569   02:13:55.579  
  you're right and that's a problem
  

02:13:55.579   02:13:57.219  
  you're right and that's a problem 
   don't  

02:13:57.219   02:13:57.229  
  because there's lots of things you don't
  

02:13:57.229   02:13:59.080  
  because there's lots of things you don't
know    you  

02:13:59.080   02:13:59.090  
know   if you get what you want you
  

02:13:59.090   02:14:00.729  
know   if you get what you want you
may     want  

02:14:00.729   02:14:00.739  
may find a that you didn't really want
 

02:14:00.739   02:14:02.370  
may find a that you didn't really want
   person  

02:14:02.370   02:14:02.380  
  it and be that you're not the person
  

02:14:02.380   02:14:05.139  
  it and be that you're not the person 
   that  

02:14:05.139   02:14:05.149  
   started the journey towards that
  

02:14:05.149   02:14:06.850  
   started the journey towards that 
   especially  

02:14:06.850   02:14:06.860  
   people especially
  

02:14:06.860   02:14:08.319  
   people especially 
   a  

02:14:08.319   02:14:08.329  
   language in a
  

02:14:08.329   02:14:10.659  
   language in a
manipulative    alternative  

02:14:10.659   02:14:10.669  
manipulative   way and so the alternative
  

02:14:10.669   02:14:12.669  
manipulative   way and so the alternative
seems     of  

02:14:12.669   02:14:12.679  
  seems to be and I think this is one of
  

02:14:12.679   02:14:14.799  
  seems to be and I think this is one of 
   out  

02:14:14.799   02:14:14.809  
   out
  

02:14:14.809   02:14:16.359  
   out
in     to  

02:14:16.359   02:14:16.369  
  in the movie Pinocchio which happens to
  

02:14:16.369   02:14:18.129  
  in the movie Pinocchio which happens to 
   mine  

02:14:18.129   02:14:18.139  
   mine
  

02:14:18.139   02:14:22.810  
   mine
is     let's  

02:14:22.810   02:14:22.820  
  is but part of the act of faith so let's
  

02:14:22.820   02:14:24.939  
  is but part of the act of faith so let's
say     wouldn't     Christian  

02:14:24.939   02:14:24.949  
say and then I wouldn't   say Christian
  

02:14:24.949   02:14:26.679  
say and then I wouldn't   say Christian
faith     in  

02:14:26.679   02:14:26.689  
faith necessarily I would say faith in
 

02:14:26.689   02:14:29.199  
faith necessarily I would say faith in
being     it's 

02:14:29.199   02:14:29.209  
being itself is is the decision it's
 

02:14:29.209   02:14:31.540  
being itself is is the decision it's
like     decision    the  

02:14:31.540   02:14:31.550  
like the decision   the
  

02:14:31.550   02:14:34.089  
like the decision   the
decision     to  

02:14:34.089   02:14:34.099  
decision is there's no better way to
 

02:14:34.099   02:14:37.270  
decision is there's no better way to
bring     into    to  

02:14:37.270   02:14:37.280  
bring better being into   being than to
  

02:14:37.280   02:14:39.250  
bring better being into   being than to 
   that's  

02:14:39.250   02:14:39.260  
   and I do think that's
  

02:14:39.260   02:14:40.569  
   and I do think that's 
   wise  

02:14:40.569   02:14:40.579  
   very wise
  

02:14:40.579   02:14:42.159  
   very wise
observation    in  

02:14:42.159   02:14:42.169  
observation   I think that's echoed in
  

02:14:42.169   02:14:42.510  
observation   I think that's echoed in
that     for  

02:14:42.510   02:14:42.520  
that for
 

02:14:42.520   02:14:44.940

and evil   yeah well I got this partly
from     Rogers  

02:17:01.169   02:17:01.179  
  from Carl Rogers you know because Rogers
  

02:17:01.179   02:17:03.030  
  from Carl Rogers you know because Rogers
was     famous  

02:17:03.030   02:17:03.040  
was either clinician very famous
 

02:17:03.040   02:17:05.430  
was either clinician very famous
clinician     was    a

02:17:06.940   02:17:08.580  
Christian missionary to begin with but
   was  

02:17:08.580   02:17:08.590  
   he was
  

02:17:08.590   02:17:10.140  
   he was 
   of  

02:17:10.140   02:17:10.150  
   interested in the utility of
  

02:17:10.150   02:17:13.200  
   interested in the utility of
listening     redemption  

02:17:13.200   02:17:13.210  
listening as a as a means of redemption
 

02:17:13.210   02:17:15.419  
listening as a as a means of redemption
   is  

02:17:15.419   02:17:15.429  
  essentially and listening by the way is
  

02:17:15.429   02:17:18.000  
  essentially and listening by the way is
if     someone     that  

02:17:18.000   02:17:18.010  
if you have someone   know that
  

02:17:18.010   02:17:19.860  
if you have someone   know that

02:17:19.870   02:17:21.930  
has a problem   the best thing you can 
   they're  

02:17:21.930   02:17:21.940  
   them if they're
  

02:17:21.940   02:17:23.330  
   them if they're
actually     because  

02:17:23.330   02:17:23.340  
actually trying   to communicate because
  

02:17:23.340   02:17:27.030  
actually trying   to communicate because 
   through  

02:17:27.030   02:17:27.040  
   configure themselves through
  

02:17:27.040   02:17:29.760  
   configure themselves through
speech     I  

02:17:29.760   02:17:29.770  
speech and most people can't think and I
 

02:17:29.770   02:17:32.040  
speech and most people can't think and I
don't   the  

02:17:32.040   02:17:32.050  
don't   I mean the
  

02:17:32.050   02:17:33.750  
don't   I mean the
way     by     they  

02:17:33.750   02:17:33.760  
way they think is by   and they
  

02:17:33.760   02:17:35.310  
way they think is by   and they
can't     talk     to  

02:17:35.310   02:17:35.320  
can't talk   to
  

02:17:35.320   02:17:37.440  
can't talk   to
talk     partly     they're  

02:17:37.440   02:17:37.450  
talk   because they're
  

02:17:37.450   02:17:39.360  
talk   because they're
bouncing     if  

02:17:39.360   02:17:39.370  
bouncing the idea off them   and seeing if
  

02:17:39.370   02:17:40.980  
bouncing the idea off them   and seeing if
it     person  

02:17:40.980   02:17:40.990  
it makes sense   and seeing how the person
  

02:17:40.990   02:17:43.080  
it makes sense   and seeing how the person
responds     is     thing  

02:17:43.080   02:17:43.090  
responds so listening is   a great thing
  

02:17:43.090   02:17:45.540  
responds so listening is   a great thing
but     in  

02:17:45.540   02:17:45.550  
but Rogers was also interested in   the in
  

02:17:45.550   02:17:47.580  
but Rogers was also interested in   the in
the    a

said I have a problem   conceivably I
could     and     something  

02:18:12.810   02:18:12.820  
could fix it and   I need to do something
  

02:18:12.820   02:18:15.270  
could fix it and   I need to do something
about     the     is  

02:18:15.270   02:18:15.280  
about   work is
  

02:18:15.280   02:18:16.680  
about   work is

   they show up 
   things  

02:18:18.180   02:18:18.190  
  because they've already said well things
  

02:18:18.190   02:18:19.530  
  because they've already said well things
aren't     and     I

aren't as good   I
  

02:18:19.540   02:18:21.300  
aren't as good   I
could     it     question  

02:18:21.300   02:18:21.310  
could do   the question
  

02:18:21.310   02:18:24.120  
could do   the question 
   who  

02:18:24.120   02:18:24.130  
   someone who
  

02:18:24.130   02:18:27.360  
   someone who
isn't     observation  

02:18:27.360   02:18:27.370  
isn't   at that state and my observation
  

02:18:27.370   02:18:29.040  
isn't   at that state and my observation
and     well  

02:18:29.040   02:18:29.050  
and   this is Rogers observation as well
  

02:18:29.050   02:18:31.709  
and   this is Rogers observation as well
is     that     serve  

02:18:31.709   02:18:31.719  
is that   you can serve
  

02:18:31.719   02:18:34.500  
is that   you can serve
by     example     has  

02:18:34.500   02:18:34.510  
by example   but until the person has
  

02:18:34.510   02:18:38.480  
by example   but until the person has
decided     wrong  

02:18:38.480   02:18:38.490  
decided   on their own that they're wrong
  

02:18:38.490   02:18:40.560  
decided   on their own that they're wrong
that's     there's  

02:18:40.560   02:18:40.570  
that's   why they're suffering if there's
  

02:18:40.570   02:18:41.879  
that's   why they're suffering if there's
something     they're     doing  

02:18:41.879   02:18:41.889  
something wrong about   doing
  

02:18:41.889   02:18:43.890  
something wrong about   doing
and    I  

02:18:43.890   02:18:43.900  
and   to fix it I don't I
  

02:18:43.900   02:18:45.870  
and   to fix it I don't I
think    against  

02:18:45.870   02:18:45.880  
think   that even trying to hammer against
  

02:18:45.880   02:18:48.150  
think   that even trying to hammer against
that     so     know  

02:18:48.150   02:18:48.160  
that often makes it worse   and I know
  

02:18:48.160   02:18:50.070  
that often makes it worse   and I know
that     talking  

02:18:50.070   02:18:50.080  
that Solzhenitsyn when he was   talking
  

02:18:50.080   02:18:52.800  
that Solzhenitsyn when he was   talking
about     really  

02:18:52.800   02:18:52.810  
about   the communist ideologue the really
  

02:18:52.810   02:18:54.510  
about   the communist ideologue the really
hardcore     were  

02:18:54.510   02:18:54.520  
hardcore communist ideologue that were
 

02:18:54.520   02:18:56.580  
hardcore communist ideologue that were

he     was    until  

02:19:00.390   02:19:00.400  
he saw the same thing was   that until
  

02:19:00.400   02:19:02.459  
he saw the same thing was   that until
they     willing     that  

02:19:02.459   02:19:02.469  
they were willing   that
  

02:19:02.469   02:19:04.890  
they were willing   that
something     the     in  

02:19:04.890   02:19:04.900  
something   manner in
  

02:19:04.900   02:19:07.020  
something   manner in
which     that  

02:19:07.020   02:19:07.030  
which they had construed the world that
 

02:19:07.030   02:19:08.669  
which they had construed the world that
it     resulted    demise  

02:19:08.669   02:19:08.679  
it had resulted   in their own demise
  

02:19:08.679   02:19:10.139  
it had resulted   in their own demise
that     of  

02:19:10.139   02:19:10.149  
that there was actually no way of
 

02:19:10.149   02:19:11.759  
that there was actually no way of
communicating   kind  

02:19:11.759   02:19:11.769  
communicating   with them they're in kind
  

02:19:11.769   02:19:15.299  
communicating   with them they're in kind 
   I  

02:19:15.299   02:19:15.309  
   and so so I I
  

02:19:15.309   02:19:19.830  
   and so so I I
don't     think     orient  

02:19:19.830   02:19:19.840  
don't   even if you orient
  

02:19:19.840   02:19:21.839  
don't   even if you orient
yourself    there's  

02:19:21.839   02:19:21.849  
yourself   as an archetypal hero there's
  

02:19:21.849   02:19:24.599  
yourself   as an archetypal hero there's
no     get     barriers  

02:19:24.599   02:19:24.609  
no way you can get   barriers
  

02:19:24.609   02:19:26.160  
no way you can get   barriers
well     that's     the  

02:19:26.160   02:19:26.170  
well I think that that's   part of the
  

02:19:26.170   02:19:28.379  
well I think that that's   part of the
issue     not  

02:19:28.379   02:19:28.389  
issue of   free will I think that I do not
  

02:19:28.389   02:19:29.910  
issue of   free will I think that I do not 
   they  

02:19:29.910   02:19:29.920  
   learn unless they
  

02:19:29.920   02:19:31.169  
   learn unless they
admit     wrong  

02:19:31.169   02:19:31.179  
admit that   they're wrong
  

02:19:31.179   02:19:35.639  
admit that   they're wrong

   I'm really hoping

   I'm really hoping 
   because  

02:20:13.260   02:20:13.270  
   something wrong because
  

02:20:13.270   02:20:15.479  
   something wrong because
if     am     and  

02:20:15.479   02:20:15.489  
if I am   could fix it and
  

02:20:15.489   02:20:17.040  
if I am   could fix it and
I'd     it's  

02:20:17.040   02:20:17.050  
I'd stop suffering   and it's it's
  

02:20:17.050   02:20:19.979  
I'd stop suffering   and it's it's 
   I  

02:20:19.979   02:20:19.989  
  something like that and see it's also I
  

02:20:19.989   02:20:22.139  
  something like that and see it's also I
think    it  

02:20:22.139   02:20:22.149  
think   what it
  

02:20:22.149   02:20:24.719  
think   what it
could     and     it  

02:20:24.719   02:20:24.729  
could be and   suffering then it
  

02:20:24.729   02:20:25.860  
could be and   suffering then it
seems     be  

02:20:25.860   02:20:25.870  
seems   to me that that should be
  

02:20:25.870   02:20:27.780  
seems   to me that that should be

nebulization   justice is
the     opposite     of

the exact opposite   process of
  

02:24:26.410   02:24:29.070  
the exact opposite   process of
individuation     is     it

individuation   and it
  

02:24:29.080   02:24:30.330  
individuation   and it
actually     you're     a

   you stomp at that
subjective     everything  

02:24:43.559   02:24:43.569  
subjective aspect where everything

   ultimately
become     relativistic     so  

02:24:47.250   02:24:47.260  
become relativistic   so
  

02:24:47.260   02:24:49.349  
become relativistic   so
I'm     asking     the  

02:24:49.349   02:24:49.359  
   that the
  

02:24:49.359   02:24:53.460  
   that the 
   myth  

02:24:53.460   02:24:53.470  
   myth
  

02:24:53.470   02:24:56.429  
   myth 
   process  

02:24:56.429   02:24:56.439  
  and God is actually the is the process
  

02:24:56.439   02:24:58.349  
  and God is actually the is the process 
   is  

02:24:58.349   02:24:58.359  
   and the Trinity is
  

02:24:58.359   02:24:59.880  
   and the Trinity is
actually     the  

02:24:59.880   02:24:59.890  
actually those three core premises the
 

02:24:59.890   02:25:00.859  
actually those three core premises the
three     axioms    come  

02:25:00.859   02:25:00.869  
three axioms   that come
  

02:25:00.869   02:25:03.800  
three axioms   that come
from     that  

02:25:03.800   02:25:03.810  
from that   okay I haven't considered that
  

02:25:03.810   02:25:08.959  
from that   okay I haven't considered that
I     know     a  

02:25:08.959   02:25:08.969  
   that young draw drew a
  

02:25:08.969   02:25:11.179  
   that young draw drew a
parallel    passion  

02:25:11.179   02:25:11.189  
parallel   between the idea of the passion
  

02:25:11.189   02:25:14.059  
parallel   between the idea of the passion
for     human  

02:25:14.059   02:25:14.069  
for example and the development of human
 

02:25:14.069   02:25:16.459  
for example and the development of human
   that  

02:25:16.459   02:25:16.469  
  individuality and so there's that that
  

02:25:16.469   02:25:19.219  
  individuality and so there's that that
idea    notion  

02:25:19.219   02:25:19.229  
   is lurking inside the union notion
  

02:25:19.229   02:25:21.019  
   is lurking inside the union notion
of     do  

02:25:21.019   02:25:21.029  
of individuation because it has to do
 

02:25:21.029   02:25:23.029  
of individuation because it has to do
   with  

02:25:23.029   02:25:23.039  
  with the voluntary confrontation with
  

02:25:23.039   02:25:25.159  
  with the voluntary confrontation with
mortality     as  

02:25:25.159   02:25:25.169  
mortality   and also with evil right as
  

02:25:25.169   02:25:28.099  
mortality   and also with evil right as
two     key     self  

02:25:28.099   02:25:28.109  
two of the key   elements of genuine self

two of the key   elements of genuine self
realization     the  

02:25:31.629   02:25:31.639  
realization   I haven't considered the
  

02:25:31.639   02:25:34.069  
realization   I haven't considered the
metaphorical    just  

02:25:34.069   02:25:34.079  
metaphorical   you just
  

02:25:34.079   02:25:36.769  
metaphorical   you just
described     that     I'd

described   I'd
have     say  

02:25:39.439   02:25:39.449  
have   to think about that but I could say
  

02:25:39.449   02:25:41.479  
have   to think about that but I could say
that     of     disturb

very deep part   is the
  

02:25:48.149   02:25:50.029  
very deep part   is the

down     refusal     to

down to its essence is   to
engage     see

02:26:08.929   02:26:08.939  
debate   and
  

02:26:08.939   02:26:11.569  
debate   and
they     don't     the  

02:26:11.569   02:26:11.579  
they don't   believe in the in the in the
  

02:26:11.579   02:26:13.999  
they don't   believe in the in the in the
let's     dialog  

02:26:13.999   02:26:14.009  
let's say the   redemptive power of dialog
  

02:26:14.009   02:26:15.679  
let's say the   redemptive power of dialog
because     what     his  

02:26:15.679   02:26:15.689  
   believe in his
  

02:26:15.689   02:26:18.109  
   believe in his
power    that  

02:26:18.109   02:26:18.119  
power   so there's a nebulization in that
  

02:26:18.119   02:26:20.300  
power   so there's a nebulization in that
manner     tendency     hide  

02:26:20.300   02:26:20.310  
manner there's this tendency   hide
  

02:26:20.310   02:26:23.239  
manner there's this tendency   hide
behind     instead  

02:26:23.239   02:26:23.249  
behind what's vague and fog like instead
 

02:26:23.249   02:26:25.129  
behind what's vague and fog like instead
   and  

02:26:25.129   02:26:25.139  
   things sharp and clear and
  

02:26:25.139   02:26:26.719  
   things sharp and clear and 
   that's  

02:26:26.719   02:26:26.729  
  crystalline and I do think that that's
  

02:26:26.729   02:26:28.669

   the  

02:27:31.400   02:27:31.410  
   the
  

02:27:31.410   02:27:34.130  
   the
structure     in  

02:27:34.130   02:27:34.140  
  structure of the biblical stories and in
  

02:27:34.140   02:27:36.350  
  structure of the biblical stories and in
this     manner     in  

02:27:36.350   02:27:36.360  
this manner   so there's this notion in
  

02:27:36.360   02:27:38.110  
this manner   so there's this notion in 
   is  

02:27:38.110   02:27:38.120  
   morality is
  

02:27:38.120   02:27:41.000

following     prohibitions  

02:27:41.000   02:27:41.010  
following a sequence   of prohibitions
  

02:27:41.010   02:27:42.620  
following a sequence   of prohibitions 
   you  

02:27:42.620   02:27:42.630  
   things you
  

02:27:42.630   02:27:44.420  
   things you
shouldn't     basically     you're  

02:27:44.420   02:27:44.430

02:27:44.430   02:27:46.969  
shouldn't do and then basically   you're
good     I     wisdom  

02:27:46.969   02:27:46.979  
good enough   think there's wisdom
  

02:27:46.979   02:27:48.590  
good enough   think there's wisdom
in     think     where

room is   in order although it is what's
important     to  

02:30:06.859   02:30:06.869  
important is that you learn how to
 

02:30:06.869   02:30:09.170  
important is that you learn how to
distinguish     and    and  

02:30:09.170   02:30:09.180  
distinguish between chaos and   order and
  

02:30:09.180   02:30:11.000  
distinguish between chaos and   order and
to     able     that  

02:30:11.000   02:30:11.010  
to be able   a manner that
  

02:30:11.010   02:30:13.429  
to be able   a manner that
produces     most     households

there's a hundred things that could be

   make it less hideous and
horrible     it's  

02:30:20.689   02:30:20.699  
horrible   and so practicing that is it's

  there's probably like five things I
could     tomorrow     morning

could do today   morning
  

02:31:06.420   02:31:08.130  
could do today   morning
is     this  

02:31:08.130   02:31:08.140  
is slightly better   than this
  

02:31:08.140   02:31:09.719  
is slightly better   than this
morning     at     not

02:31:11.969   02:31:11.979  
   usually be
  

02:31:11.979   02:31:14.219  
   usually be
like     in     morning  

02:31:14.219   02:31:14.229  
like   the morning
  

02:31:14.229   02:31:15.450  
like   the morning 
   be  

02:31:15.450   02:31:15.460  
   not going to be
  

02:31:15.460   02:31:16.710  
   not going to be
something     do     be  

02:31:16.710   02:31:16.720  
something   there'll be
  

02:31:16.720   02:31:18.269  
something   there'll be
things    there  

02:31:18.269   02:31:18.279  
things   to avoid there
  

02:31:18.279   02:31:20.729  
things   to avoid there
snakes     ask  

02:31:20.729   02:31:20.739  
snakes   essentially but if you ask
  

02:31:20.739   02:31:22.590  
snakes   essentially but if you ask 
   someone  

02:31:22.590   02:31:22.600  
   someone
  

02:31:22.600   02:31:24.990  
   someone
which     of     you  

02:31:24.990   02:31:25.000  
which i think is a form of   prayer if you
  

02:31:25.000   02:31:27.090  
which i think is a form of   prayer if you
ask    yourself  

02:31:27.090   02:31:27.100  
ask   yourself instead of telling yourself
  

02:31:27.100   02:31:28.979  
ask   yourself instead of telling yourself
you     to  

02:31:28.979   02:31:28.989  
you know what is it   that I could do to
  

02:31:28.989   02:31:32.729  
you know what is it   that I could do to 
   would  

02:31:32.729   02:31:32.739  
  set things more right today that I would
  

02:31:32.739   02:31:35.550  
  set things more right today that I would
actually     small  

02:31:35.550   02:31:35.560  
actually   do it's usually some small
  

02:31:35.560   02:31:37.080  
actually   do it's usually some small
thing     that     disciplined  

02:31:37.080   02:31:37.090  
thing because he's not   disciplined
  

02:31:37.090   02:31:39.660  
thing because he's not   disciplined
you     know     then  

02:31:39.660   02:31:39.670  
you know   go do it and then
  

02:31:39.670   02:31:41.939  
you know   go do it and then
you     little  

02:31:41.939   02:31:41.949  
you you put the world   together a little
  

02:31:41.949   02:31:44.729  
you you put the world   together a little 
   spreads  

02:31:44.729   02:31:44.739  
   and that spreads
  

02:31:44.739   02:31:47.120  
   and that spreads
out     put     also  

02:31:47.120   02:31:47.130  
out but you also put   your you also
  

02:31:47.130   02:31:49.559  
out but you also put   your you also
construct     something     that's  

02:31:49.559   02:31:49.569  
construct yourself into something   that's
  

02:31:49.569   02:31:53.099  
construct yourself into something   that's
better     able     from  

02:31:53.099   02:31:53.109  
better able   to call order forth from
  

02:31:53.109   02:31:54.780  
better able   to call order forth from
chaos     that     just  

02:31:54.780   02:31:54.790  
chaos and that   makes you just
  

02:31:54.790   02:31:58.080  
chaos and that   makes you just 
   next  

02:31:58.080   02:31:58.090  
  incrementally stronger and then the next
  

02:31:58.090   02:32:00.149  
  incrementally stronger and then the next
day    slightly  

02:32:00.149   02:32:00.159  
day   a slightly
  

02:32:00.159   02:32:03.059  
day   a slightly
larger     benefit  

02:32:03.059   02:32:03.069  
larger task and like you get the benefit
 

02:32:03.069   02:32:05.160  
larger task and like you get the benefit
of     if    it's  

02:32:05.160   02:32:05.170  
of compound interest if   you do that it's
  

02:32:05.170   02:32:07.110  
of compound interest if   you do that it's
a     and  

02:32:07.110   02:32:07.120  
a tremendously powerful technique and
 

02:32:07.120   02:32:09.800  
a tremendously powerful technique and
they     you    point  

02:32:09.800   02:32:09.810  
they think if you   do that at some point
  

02:32:09.810   02:32:12.599  
they think if you   do that at some point
instead     up  

02:32:12.599   02:32:12.609  
  instead of just having to fix things up
  

02:32:12.609   02:32:14.639  
  instead of just having to fix things up
that    a  

02:32:14.639   02:32:14.649  
that   you'll start to get a
  

02:32:14.649   02:32:16.710  
that   you'll start to get a
glimmer    you  

02:32:16.710   02:32:16.720  
glimmer   you
  

02:32:16.720   02:32:19.920  
glimmer   you
could     you     positive  

02:32:19.920   02:32:19.930  
could do you   know you did the positive
  

02:32:19.930   02:32:20.969  
could do you   know you did the positive
things     that     would  

02:32:20.969   02:32:20.979  
things that   you could do that would
  

02:32:20.979   02:32:23.010  
things that   you could do that would
actually     now  

02:32:23.010   02:32:23.020  
actually constitute a vision and now
 

02:32:23.020   02:32:25.349  
actually constitute a vision and now
that's   you  

02:32:25.349   02:32:25.359  
that's   what I would recommend thank you
  

02:32:25.359   02:32:30.710  
that's   what I would recommend thank you 
   night  

02:32:30.710   02:32:30.720
