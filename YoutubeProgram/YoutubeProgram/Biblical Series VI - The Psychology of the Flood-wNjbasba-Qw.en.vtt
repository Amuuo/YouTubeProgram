so I'm going   launch right into it I
  

00:00:16.440   00:00:19.910  
so I'm going   launch right into it I
like     well     the  

00:00:19.910   00:00:19.920  
like this story as well   this is the
  

00:00:19.920   00:00:22.490  
like this story as well   this is the
story     of     the  

00:00:22.490   00:00:22.500  
story of   Noah and the flood and then the
  

00:00:22.500   00:00:25.160  
story of   Noah and the flood and then the
Tower     are  

00:00:25.160   00:00:25.170  
Tower of Babel   which I think are
  

00:00:25.170   00:00:27.800  
Tower of Babel   which I think are
juxtaposed     Tower  

00:00:27.800   00:00:27.810  
juxtaposed very interestingly the Tower
 

00:00:27.810   00:00:29.630  
juxtaposed very interestingly the Tower
of     stories    like  

00:00:29.630   00:00:29.640  
of Babel is one of those stories   like
  

00:00:29.640   00:00:31.189  
of Babel is one of those stories   like
Cain    lines  

00:00:31.189   00:00:31.199  
Cain   only a few lines
  

00:00:31.199   00:00:33.770  
Cain   only a few lines
long     like     sense  

00:00:33.770   00:00:33.780  
long   a fragment in some sense
  

00:00:33.780   00:00:35.810  
long   a fragment in some sense
although     a  

00:00:35.810   00:00:35.820  
although the story of Noah is quite a
 

00:00:35.820   00:00:39.590  
although the story of Noah is quite a
well-developed     the 

00:00:39.590   00:00:39.600  
well-developed narrative but like the
 

00:00:39.600   00:00:43.010  
well-developed narrative but like the
   is  

00:00:43.010   00:00:43.020  
   we've covered it is
  

00:00:43.020   00:00:45.380  
   we've covered it is
relevant     levels     analysis

00:00:48.899   00:00:52.100  
simultaneously   and so what I'm going to
do     to     some

do to begin   start with some
background    some  

00:00:54.439   00:00:54.449  
background   information so some
  

00:00:54.449   00:00:56.720  
background   information so some
psychological     so  

00:00:56.720   00:00:56.730  
  psychological background information so
  

00:00:56.730   00:00:59.959  
  psychological background information so
that     first  

00:00:59.959   00:00:59.969  
that the story makes sense and the first
 

00:00:59.969   00:01:02.299  
that the story makes sense and the first
thing   make  

00:01:02.299   00:01:02.309  
thing   I'd like to make
  

00:01:02.309   00:01:06.770  
thing   I'd like to make
a     bringing  

00:01:06.770   00:01:06.780  
a case for is that the   you're bringing

to bear on the world   an a priori
  

00:01:08.970   00:01:12.080  
to bear on the world   an a priori
perceptual     really  

00:01:12.080   00:01:12.090  
perceptual structure and that's   really

perceptual structure and that's   really
an     a  

00:01:13.609   00:01:13.619  
an embodied structure and it's a
 

00:01:13.619   00:01:15.679

   is  

00:01:25.429   00:01:25.439  
   because your mind is

can     them  

00:02:06.770   00:02:06.780  
can walk if you   if you suspend them
  

00:02:06.780   00:02:08.359  
can walk if you   if you suspend them
above     walk

so     quite  

00:02:12.740   00:02:12.750  
so your spine   is capable of quite
  

00:02:12.750   00:02:13.580  
so your spine   is capable of quite
complex 

00:02:13.580   00:02:13.590  
complex
 

00:02:13.590   00:02:15.800  
complex
tivity     it's 

00:02:15.800   00:02:15.810  
tivity in fact when you walk mostly it's
 

00:02:15.810   00:02:17.630  
tivity in fact when you walk mostly it's
a     spine 

00:02:17.630   00:02:17.640  
a controlled fall and mostly your spine
 

00:02:17.640   00:02:22.490  
a controlled fall and mostly your spine
is     the    point  

00:02:22.490   00:02:22.500  
is doing it and so so anyways the   point
  

00:02:22.500   00:02:25.160  
is doing it and so so anyways the   point
of     you     a

straightforward sense you have a   built
in     that's

extraordinarily     and

it's     good     the

  clearest answer to that is that it's a

partly because   we're limited creatures
and     on     siient

the scientific method   actually does that 
   a

  and so the fact that we've evolved a

  and so the fact that we've evolved a

a     thinking     the  

00:10:27.220   00:10:27.230  
a good   it so the
  

00:10:27.230   00:10:31.210  
a good   it so the 
   the  

00:10:31.210   00:10:31.220  
   that we tell have exactly the
  

00:10:31.220   00:10:36.370  
   that we tell have exactly the
same     have     core  

00:10:36.370   00:10:36.380  
same   this is core
  

00:10:36.380   00:10:38.440  
same   this is core
element     alright  

00:10:38.440   00:10:38.450  
element with variations and so   alright
  

00:10:38.450   00:10:41.380  
element with variations and so   alright
I'll     to     the  

00:10:41.380   00:10:41.390  
I'll turn   so the
  

00:10:41.390   00:10:43.690  
I'll turn   so the 
   a  

00:10:43.690   00:10:43.700  
   as I mentioned is come a
  

00:10:43.700   00:10:46.960  
   as I mentioned is come a
complexity    too  

00:10:46.960   00:10:46.970  
complexity   problem things are just too
  

00:10:46.970   00:10:49.510  
complexity   problem things are just too 
   that  

00:10:49.510   00:10:49.520  
  complicated to get a handle on and that
  

00:10:49.520   00:10:50.890  
  complicated to get a handle on and that
actually     consequences  

00:10:50.890   00:10:50.900  
actually has serious consequences
 

00:10:50.900   00:10:53.110  
actually has serious consequences
   everyone  

00:10:53.110   00:10:53.120  
   everyone
  

00:10:53.120   00:10:55.000  
   everyone 
   so  

00:10:55.000   00:10:55.010  
  eventually is that their lives become so
  

00:10:55.010   00:10:58.690  
  eventually is that their lives become so 
   that  

00:10:58.690   00:10:58.700  
   they die so and that
  

00:10:58.700   00:11:00.760  
   they die so and that
and     terrible     you  

00:11:00.760   00:11:00.770  
and many terrible   things can happen you
  

00:11:00.770   00:11:02.500  
and many terrible   things can happen you
on     are  

00:11:02.500   00:11:02.510  
on the way to dying as well that are
 

00:11:02.510   00:11:06.040  
on the way to dying as well that are
complex   can  

00:11:06.040   00:11:06.050  
complex   complexity related right you can
  

00:11:06.050   00:11:07.450

people     they

people who are suicidal   for example they

matter which way they turn there's
something     they 

00:11:29.410   00:11:29.420  
something terrible to face and they

something terrible to face and they
can't     any    and

can't see any   out of it and
  

00:11:31.059   00:11:33.999  
can't see any   out of it and
sometimes     more     you'd  

00:11:33.999   00:11:34.009  
sometimes that's more   true than you'd

sometimes that's more   true than you'd
like    to

that's     that's

that's a   drink but a lot of water that's

the those are the extremes now there are

the those are the extremes now there are
accounts     of    in

accounts that are sort of   sub texts in

   God conquering a great
  

00:15:30.589   00:15:35.199

these   elements and

making the world   at the consequence of 
   that  

00:15:44.379   00:15:44.389  
   so there's this idea that
  

00:15:44.389   00:15:46.780  
   so there's this idea that
the     we've  

00:15:46.780   00:15:46.790  
the world creating force which we've
 

00:15:46.790   00:15:48.910  
the world creating force which we've
talked     the    thing  

00:15:48.910   00:15:48.920  
talked about as the   logos is the thing
  

00:15:48.920   00:15:51.549  
talked about as the   logos is the thing
that     and  

00:15:51.549   00:15:51.559  
that continually confronts chaos and
 

00:15:51.559   00:15:54.340  
that continually confronts chaos and
   is  

00:15:54.340   00:15:54.350  
   thinking about chaos is
  

00:15:54.350   00:15:56.979  
   thinking about chaos is
as     predatory     and  

00:15:56.979   00:15:56.989  
as a predatory   reptilian monster and
  

00:15:56.989   00:15:58.900  
as a predatory   reptilian monster and
often     are  

00:15:58.900   00:15:58.910  
often one   that lives in the depths are
  

00:15:58.910   00:16:01.359  
often one   that lives in the depths are
perhaps    I  

00:16:01.359   00:16:01.369  
perhaps   I
  

00:16:01.369   00:16:03.129  
perhaps   I
think     is     our  

00:16:03.129   00:16:03.139  
   because we actually use our
  

00:16:03.139   00:16:04.929  
   because we actually use our
predator     this  

00:16:04.929   00:16:04.939  
predator detection circuit to do this
 

00:16:04.939   00:16:07.329  
predator detection circuit to do this
sort   so  

00:16:07.329   00:16:07.339  
sort   of pre cognitive process and so
  

00:16:07.339   00:16:08.919  
sort   of pre cognitive process and so 
   is  

00:16:08.919   00:16:08.929  
  that the notion fundamentally is
  

00:16:08.929   00:16:10.389  
  that the notion fundamentally is

  well a lot and why is that is because 
   you're  

00:17:34.690   00:17:34.700  
  the house falls apart because you're
  

00:17:34.700   00:17:37.060  
  the house falls apart because you're

00:17:37.060   00:17:37.070  
stupid   and the house falls apart well
  

00:17:37.070   00:17:38.529

ignore     this  

00:17:40.960   00:17:40.970

  but even if you're confident the house
falls    and

falls   right it's just entropy and
  

00:17:48.590   00:17:50.230  
falls   right it's just entropy and
so     a     fall  

00:17:50.230   00:17:50.240  
so things have a   proclivity to fall
  

00:17:50.240   00:17:51.850  
so things have a   proclivity to fall

basis and   is well what
do     about     ignore  

00:22:23.500   00:22:23.510  
do you do about   that and if you ignore

do you do about   that and if you ignore 
   so  

00:22:24.850   00:22:24.860  
   it gets worse so

   it gets worse so 
   know

   we know

   we know
what    it  

00:22:28.630   00:22:28.640  
what   doesn't work and so if ignoring it
  

00:22:28.640   00:22:30.880  
what   doesn't work and so if ignoring it
doesn't     to     might

way of   looking at things but it is

to   I did
  

00:26:25.350   00:26:26.660  
to   I did
this     was  

00:26:26.660   00:26:26.670  
this with a client of   mine who was
  

00:26:26.670   00:26:29.270  
this with a client of   mine who was

bed   they were having a fight every night 
   studies  

00:26:33.980   00:26:33.990  
  and I knew by that time the studies
  

00:26:33.990   00:26:36.740  
  and I knew by that time the studies
indicate     20  

00:26:36.740   00:26:36.750  
indicate that   most parents only spend 20
  

00:26:36.750   00:26:38.720

  minutes per day of one-on-one time with 
   is

00:27:05.820   00:27:08.930  
no no no   if it happens every day
it's     catastrophe     so  

00:27:08.930   00:27:08.940  
it's a catastrophe   so you do the math so
  

00:27:08.940   00:27:10.880  
it's a catastrophe   so you do the math so
we'll     say     sake

  right that's just way too much time to
spend    you  

00:27:35.300   00:27:35.310  
spend   doing something like that if you
  

00:27:35.310   00:27:36.290

just   too it's just too punishing and so
well     need  

00:27:44.210   00:27:44.220  
well so you need structure   you need
  

00:27:44.220   00:27:46.070  
well so you need structure   you need
predictability     more     it

because other people can   tolerate having 
   extensive  

00:29:25.570   00:29:25.580  
  you around for reasonably extensive
  

00:29:25.580   00:29:27.730  
  you around for reasonably extensive
periods     and     across  

00:29:27.730   00:29:27.740  
periods of time and   will cuff you across
  

00:29:27.740   00:29:29.380  
periods of time and   will cuff you across
the     back     do  

00:29:29.380   00:29:29.390  
the back   time you do
  

00:29:29.390   00:29:31.180  
the back   time you do
something     will  

00:29:31.180   00:29:31.190  
something   so stupid that people will
  

00:29:31.190   00:29:33.640  
something   so stupid that people will 
   continue  

00:29:33.640   00:29:33.650  
   you continue
  

00:29:33.650   00:29:35.740  
   you continue 
   each  

00:29:35.740   00:29:35.750  
  and so what people are doing to each
  

00:29:35.750   00:29:39.030  
  and so what people are doing to each 
   is  

00:29:39.030   00:29:39.040  
   the time just non-stop is
  

00:29:39.040   00:29:41.800  
   the time just non-stop is
broadcasting     and  

00:29:41.800   00:29:41.810  
broadcasting sanity signals back and
 

00:29:41.810   00:29:44.080  
broadcasting sanity signals back and
forth   at  

00:29:44.080   00:29:44.090  
forth   right it's like you smile at
  

00:29:44.090   00:29:45.850  
forth   right it's like you smile at
people     not  

00:29:45.850   00:29:45.860  
people   if they're well if they're not
  

00:29:45.860   00:29:48.070

what happens to   don't
  

00:30:46.040   00:30:48.430  
what happens to   don't
have     routine     as

have a routine   and they get isolated as

they start to   drift and they drift badly
  

00:30:51.020   00:30:53.650  
they start to   drift and they drift badly

   all by yourself 
   so  

00:31:00.010   00:31:00.020  
  you just cannot do it so a lot of our so
  

00:31:00.020   00:31:02.410  
  you just cannot do it so a lot of our so
we     outsource     and

we outsource   the problem of sanity and

we outsource   the problem of sanity and
it's     outsource

it's very intelligent   that we outsource
the     is

the problem of sanity because sanity is

   figure  

00:31:50.410   00:31:50.420  
   the way we figure
  

00:31:50.420   00:31:51.910  
   the way we figure
it     it's  

00:31:51.910   00:31:51.920  
it out because it's actually   it's
  

00:31:51.920   00:31:54.040  
it out because it's actually   it's
technically     why  

00:31:54.040   00:31:54.050  
technically   impossible that's partly why
  

00:31:54.050   00:31:55.600  
technically   impossible that's partly why
the     then  

00:31:55.600   00:31:55.610  
the stock market explodes now and then
 

00:31:55.610   00:31:57.100  
the stock market explodes now and then
and     all    of  

00:31:57.100   00:31:57.110  
and there's bubbles and all   that sort of
  

00:31:57.110   00:32:02.020  
and there's bubbles and all   that sort of
thing     things  

00:32:02.020   00:32:02.030  
thing but anyways the point   is things
  

00:32:02.030   00:32:05.320  
thing but anyways the point   is things 
   when

mostly    to  

00:33:06.700   00:33:06.710  
mostly   what you're taught is how to
  

00:33:06.710   00:33:08.050  
mostly   what you're taught is how to
communicate     other     an

   people in an
acceptable     manner     can  

00:33:11.050   00:33:11.060  
acceptable   and then once you can
  

00:33:11.060   00:33:13.000  
acceptable   and then once you can
communicate     people     acceptable  

00:33:13.000   00:33:13.010  
communicate   in an acceptable
  

00:33:13.010   00:33:14.410  
communicate   in an acceptable 
   your  

00:33:14.410   00:33:14.420  
   you can outsource your
  

00:33:14.420   00:33:16.270  
   you can outsource your
problems     constantly     doing  

00:33:16.270   00:33:16.280  
problems constantly   but you're doing
  

00:33:16.280   00:33:17.640  
problems constantly   but you're doing
constantly     this  

00:33:17.640   00:33:17.650  
  constantly and so we're in this
  

00:33:17.650   00:33:20.260  
  constantly and so we're in this
continual     of  

00:33:20.260   00:33:20.270  
continual dynamic   exchange of

00:39:25.880   00:39:25.890  
   all right so what
  

00:39:25.890   00:39:27.620  
   all right so what
does     it  

00:39:27.620   00:39:27.630  
does the frame look like well I think   it
  

00:39:27.630   00:39:29.450  
does the frame look like well I think   it
looks     as  

00:39:29.450   00:39:29.460  
  looks something like this and this is as
  

00:39:29.460   00:39:30.999  
  looks something like this and this is as

00:39:30.999   00:39:31.009  
   as I can tell this is the bare-bones

that     because  

00:39:55.370   00:39:55.380  
  that you're in you're somewhere because
  

00:39:55.380   00:39:57.109  
  that you're in you're somewhere because 
   might  

00:39:57.109   00:39:57.119  
   now you might
  

00:39:57.119   00:39:58.430  
   now you might
not     know     is  

00:39:58.430   00:39:58.440  
not know   that is
  

00:39:58.440   00:40:00.710  
not know   that is
which     are  

00:40:00.710   00:40:00.720  
which means that somewhere that you are
 

00:40:00.720   00:40:03.349  
which means that somewhere that you are
is   go  

00:40:03.349   00:40:03.359  
is   chaotic in which case you need to go
  

00:40:03.359   00:40:05.479  
is   chaotic in which case you need to go 
   and  

00:40:05.479   00:40:05.489  
   in great detail and
  

00:40:05.489   00:40:07.400  
   in great detail and 
   so  

00:40:07.400   00:40:07.410  
  figure out where you are so
  

00:40:07.410   00:40:09.650  
  figure out where you are so
you're     here     and  

00:40:09.650   00:40:09.660  
you're   you're lost and
  

00:40:09.660   00:40:11.359  
you're   you're lost and 
   when  

00:40:11.359   00:40:11.369  
  the problem with being lost is when
  

00:40:11.369   00:40:12.950  
  the problem with being lost is when
you're     lost     go  

00:40:12.950   00:40:12.960  
you're lost   to go
  

00:40:12.960   00:40:14.359  
you're lost   to go
and    where  

00:40:14.359   00:40:14.369  
and   knowing where
  

00:40:14.369   00:40:16.339  
and   knowing where
to    that  

00:40:16.339   00:40:16.349  
to   go is there's a million places that
  

00:40:16.349   00:40:18.620  
to   go is there's a million places that
you     too  

00:40:18.620   00:40:18.630  
you could   go and a million places is too
  

00:40:18.630   00:40:20.870  
you could   go and a million places is too
many     for     dying  

00:40:20.870   00:40:20.880  
many   without dying
  

00:40:20.880   00:40:23.599  
many   without dying
so     good     to  

00:40:23.599   00:40:23.609  
so being   so you need to
  

00:40:23.609   00:40:25.880  
so being   so you need to
know    things  

00:40:25.880   00:40:25.890  
know   where you are one of the things
  

00:40:25.890   00:40:28.309  
know   where you are one of the things
that     online     I

00:42:24.010   00:42:25.560  
years old   like that and maybe 
   because  

00:42:25.560   00:42:25.570  
   because
  

00:42:25.570   00:42:27.660  
   because
that's     abusing  

00:42:27.660   00:42:27.670  
that's   generally who does the abusing
  

00:42:27.670   00:42:29.970  
that's   generally who does the abusing
and     just     then  

00:42:29.970   00:42:29.980  
and so that just   makes it works and then
  

00:42:29.980   00:42:32.540  
and so that just   makes it works and then
what     a  

00:42:32.540   00:42:32.550  
what that   means is that you've got a
  

00:42:32.550   00:42:35.910  
what that   means is that you've got a
implicit    encounter  

00:42:35.910   00:42:35.920  
implicit   you had an implicit encounter
  

00:42:35.920   00:42:39.330

of malevolent evil   that's plaguing you
  

00:42:45.580   00:42:47.580  
of malevolent evil   that's plaguing you
it's     the

here   your your body encounters the world
  

00:43:35.080   00:43:36.720  
here   your your body encounters the world
in     happens     very  

00:43:36.720   00:43:36.730  
in   very
  

00:43:36.730   00:43:38.970  
in   very
rapidly     years  

00:43:38.970   00:43:38.980  
rapidly   well it can extend over years
  

00:43:38.980   00:43:40.500  
rapidly   well it can extend over years
but     initial     very  

00:43:40.500   00:43:40.510  
but the initial   very
  

00:43:40.510   00:43:42.960  
but the initial   very
rapidly    walking  

00:43:42.960   00:43:42.970  
   so for example if you're walking
  

00:43:42.970   00:43:44.490  
   so for example if you're walking
down    noise  

00:43:44.490   00:43:44.500  
down   and you hear a large noise
  

00:43:44.500   00:43:46.950  
down   and you hear a large noise 
   this  

00:43:46.950   00:43:46.960  
  be a loud noise behind you go like this
  

00:43:46.960   00:43:49.410  
  be a loud noise behind you go like this
that's     by  

00:43:49.410   00:43:49.420  
that's   a predator defense response by
  

00:43:49.420   00:43:51.360  
that's   a predator defense response by
the     to  

00:43:51.360   00:43:51.370  
  the way you crouch down and that's to
  

00:43:51.370   00:43:53.280  
  the way you crouch down and that's to
stop     back  

00:43:53.280   00:43:53.290  
stop something from   jumping on your back
  

00:43:53.290   00:43:54.690  
stop something from   jumping on your back
and     easily  

00:43:54.690   00:43:54.700  
  and getting at your neck too easily
  

00:43:54.700   00:43:56.700  
  and getting at your neck too easily
that's     million     hundred  

00:43:56.700   00:43:56.710  
   two hundred
  

00:43:56.710   00:43:58.470  
   two hundred 
   even  

00:43:58.470   00:43:58.480  
  milliseconds it's really fast or even
  

00:43:58.480   00:44:00.030  
  milliseconds it's really fast or even 
   be  

00:44:00.030   00:44:00.040  
   it better be
  

00:44:00.040   00:44:02.280  
   it better be
because    will  

00:44:02.280   00:44:02.290  
because   like will
  

00:44:02.290   00:44:04.140  
because   like will
say     you     so  

00:44:04.140   00:44:04.150  
say it can nail you   just right now so
  

00:44:04.150   00:44:05.730  
say it can nail you   just right now so
you    low  

00:44:05.730   00:44:05.740  
you   but it's low
  

00:44:05.740   00:44:08.130  
you   but it's low
resolution     snake  

00:44:08.130   00:44:08.140  
resolution it's like danger snake
 

00:44:08.140   00:44:10.290  
resolution it's like danger snake
something     like    predatory  

00:44:10.290   00:44:10.300  
something like   that or danger predatory
  

00:44:10.300   00:44:13.740  
something like   that or danger predatory 
   can  

00:44:13.740   00:44:13.750  
   and then you can
  

00:44:13.750   00:44:17.880  
   and then you can 
   that  

00:44:17.880   00:44:17.890  
  unravel that and categorize it but that
  

00:44:17.890   00:44:20.100  
  unravel that and categorize it but that
takes     time     and  

00:44:20.100   00:44:20.110  
takes time   you do that with emotion and
  

00:44:20.110   00:44:21.690  
takes time   you do that with emotion and 
   do  

00:44:21.690   00:44:21.700  
  then you do it with cognition you can do
  

00:44:21.700   00:44:23.310  
  then you do it with cognition you can do
that     with     know  

00:44:23.310   00:44:23.320  
that with   long term thinking you know
  

00:44:23.320   00:44:24.990  
that with   long term thinking you know
because     maybe     someone  

00:44:24.990   00:44:25.000  
because maybe   you've encountered someone
  

00:44:25.000   00:44:27.090  
because maybe   you've encountered someone
specifically     at

you're   acting like a prey animal and

you're kind of like a   two-year-old

you're kind of like a   two-year-old

  you know just it's one emotional frame 
   dominance  

00:53:04.580   00:53:04.590  
  after another vying for dominance
  

00:53:04.590   00:53:07.130

there's no overarching hierarchy   and

there's no overarching hierarchy   and
there's     you  

00:53:10.820   00:53:10.830  
there's no king at the top   and so you
  

00:53:10.830   00:53:12.830  
there's no king at the top   and so you
know     pyramids     of

the neural structure of your   being you
  

00:53:29.250   00:53:32.390  
the neural structure of your   being you
want    the  

00:53:32.390   00:53:32.400  
want   to put something in control and the
  

00:53:32.400   00:53:33.920  
want   to put something in control and the 
   is  

00:53:33.920   00:53:33.930  
   you should put in control is
  

00:53:33.930   00:53:36.019  
   you should put in control is
the     and  

00:53:36.019   00:53:36.029  
  the bloody thing that pays attention and
  

00:53:36.029   00:53:38.599  
  the bloody thing that pays attention and
learns    the

thing   that pays attention and learns and
  

00:53:43.740   00:53:46.009  
thing   that pays attention and learns and
you     the  

00:53:46.009   00:53:46.019  
you could   think well that's that's the
  

00:53:46.019   00:53:48.170  
you could   think well that's that's the
message     logos     for  

00:53:48.170   00:53:48.180  
message of   that's for
  

00:53:48.180   00:53:50.180  
message of   that's for 
   attention  

00:53:50.180   00:53:50.190  
  sure because logos is partly attention
  

00:53:50.190   00:53:52.309  
  sure because logos is partly attention
and     a  

00:53:52.309   00:53:52.319  
and partly communication and you learn a
 

00:53:52.319   00:53:54.500  
and partly communication and you learn a
lot   so  

00:53:54.500   00:53:54.510  
lot   okay so
  

00:53:54.510   00:53:57.740  
lot   okay so
you     need     like  

00:53:57.740   00:53:57.750  
you need   know where you are just like
  

00:53:57.750   00:53:59.930  
you need   know where you are just like 
   closest  

00:53:59.930   00:53:59.940  
  your GPS which is about the closest
  

00:53:59.940   00:54:01.339  
  your GPS which is about the closest 
   intelligent  

00:54:01.339   00:54:01.349  
  thing we have to an intelligent
  

00:54:01.349   00:54:03.769

cybernetic system those GPS   is in your
  

00:54:03.779   00:54:05.120  
cybernetic system those GPS   is in your 
   pretty  

00:54:05.120   00:54:05.130  
   are pretty
  

00:54:05.130   00:54:07.400  
   are pretty
smart     where  

00:54:07.400   00:54:07.410  
smart   because they can they know where
  

00:54:07.410   00:54:08.720  
smart   because they can they know where
you     are     and

you are   and
  

00:54:08.730   00:54:10.579  
you are   and
if     off     recalculate  

00:54:10.579   00:54:10.589  
if you go off   course they recalculate

if you go off   course they recalculate
your    are  

00:54:12.079   00:54:12.089  
your   route it's like those things are
  

00:54:12.089   00:54:14.329  
your   route it's like those things are
damn    to

intelligence it's and   you can tell that 
   they  

00:54:18.049   00:54:18.059  
  because they act intelligently they
  

00:54:18.059   00:54:21.079  
  because they act intelligently they
solve     need  

00:54:21.079   00:54:21.089  
solve problems continually so you need

00:54:28.579   00:54:28.589  
it's not   so you need to know
  

00:54:28.589   00:54:30.200  
it's not   so you need to know 
   where  

00:54:30.200   00:54:30.210  
   to know where
  

00:54:30.210   00:54:31.730  
   to know where
you're     thing     you  

00:54:31.730   00:54:31.740  
you're going and   you
  

00:54:31.740   00:54:33.559  
you're going and   you
need     that     you're  

00:54:33.559   00:54:33.569  
need   you're
  

00:54:33.569   00:54:36.529  
need   you're
going    you're  

00:54:36.529   00:54:36.539  
   move your body how you're
  

00:54:36.539   00:54:38.809  
   move your body how you're
going    time  

00:54:38.809   00:54:38.819  
going   to propel yourself through time
  

00:54:38.819   00:54:41.450  
going   to propel yourself through time
and     space     that  

00:54:41.450   00:54:41.460  
and space   that
  

00:54:41.460   00:54:44.569  
and space   that
and     so     make  

00:54:44.569   00:54:44.579  
and so   can we can make
  

00:54:44.579   00:54:46.160  
and so   can we can make
that     because  

00:54:46.160   00:54:46.170  
that a little   bit more complex because
  

00:54:46.170   00:54:48.339  
that a little   bit more complex because
it's     simple     this  

00:54:48.339   00:54:48.349  
it's a bit too simple   so we'll do this
  

00:54:48.349   00:54:50.930  
it's a bit too simple   so we'll do this
so     exactly     one  

00:54:50.930   00:54:50.940  
so it isn't exactly   in one
  

00:54:50.940   00:54:53.089  
so it isn't exactly   in one
of    nested  

00:54:53.089   00:54:53.099  
of   a nested
  

00:54:53.099   00:54:55.400  
of   a nested
hierarchy     could     think  

00:54:55.400   00:54:55.410  
hierarchy of these and you could   think
  

00:54:55.410   00:54:57.920  
hierarchy of these and you could   think
of     this     patriarchy  

00:54:57.920   00:54:57.930  
   as your own internal patriarchy
  

00:54:57.930   00:54:59.359  
   as your own internal patriarchy
that's     about     it  

00:54:59.359   00:54:59.369  
that's a good way of   it
  

00:54:59.369   00:55:01.640  
that's a good way of   it
and     could     maybe  

00:55:01.640   00:55:01.650  
   or maybe
  

00:55:01.650   00:55:03.589  
   or maybe
it     could     you  

00:55:03.589   00:55:03.599  
it   something that gives you
  

00:55:03.599   00:55:05.990  
it   something that gives you
security     and  

00:55:05.990   00:55:06.000  
security   and functional autonomy and
  

00:55:06.000   00:55:07.609  
security   and functional autonomy and
hopefully     for     it  

00:55:07.609   00:55:07.619  
hopefully that's   it
  

00:55:07.619   00:55:09.740  
hopefully that's   it
but     a     a  

00:55:09.740   00:55:09.750  
but it's a   battle you know because a
  

00:55:09.750   00:55:13.579  
but it's a   battle you know because a
little     everyone  

00:55:13.579   00:55:13.589  
little bit of tyranny exists in   everyone
  

00:55:13.589   00:55:17.990  
little bit of tyranny exists in   everyone 
   level  

00:55:17.990   00:55:18.000  
  and so well so at the very highest level
  

00:55:18.000   00:55:19.819  
  and so well so at the very highest level
of     the  

00:55:19.819   00:55:19.829  
of analysis   that would be the
  

00:55:19.829   00:55:22.579  
of analysis   that would be the
overarching     you     I'd  

00:55:22.579   00:55:22.589  
overarching story maybe you   think I'd
  

00:55:22.589   00:55:24.529  
overarching story maybe you   think I'd
like    successful  

00:55:24.529   00:55:24.539  
like   be a good person or a successful
  

00:55:24.539   00:55:26.539  
like   be a good person or a successful 
   person  

00:55:26.539   00:55:26.549  
  person or famous person
  

00:55:26.549   00:55:28.309  
  person or famous person
I     think     better  

00:55:28.309   00:55:28.319  
I think   Goods probably a bit better
  

00:55:28.319   00:55:29.720  
I think   Goods probably a bit better
because    the  

00:55:29.720   00:55:29.730  
because   with the
  

00:55:29.730   00:55:31.460  
because   with the 
   long  

00:55:31.460   00:55:31.470  
   long
  

00:55:31.470   00:55:32.839  
   long 
   too  

00:55:32.839   00:55:32.849  
   it doesn't annoy other people too
  

00:55:32.849   00:55:34.700  
   it doesn't annoy other people too
badly 

00:55:34.700   00:55:34.710  
badly
 

00:55:34.710   00:55:36.900  
badly
because     they'll    and  

00:55:36.900   00:55:36.910  
because they'll   your way and
  

00:55:36.910   00:55:39.210  
because they'll   your way and
that     helpful     to  

00:55:39.210   00:55:39.220  
   so you have to
  

00:55:39.220   00:55:41.520  
   so you have to 
   good  

00:55:41.520   00:55:41.530  
   it but let's say you're a good
  

00:55:41.530   00:55:44.400  
   it but let's say you're a good
person    the  

00:55:44.400   00:55:44.410  
person   story at the
  

00:55:44.410   00:55:47.070  
person   story at the
top     could  

00:55:47.070   00:55:47.080  
top of the   hierarchy and then you could
  

00:55:47.080   00:55:49.320  
top of the   hierarchy and then you could
decompose    roles  

00:55:49.320   00:55:49.330  
decompose   roles
  

00:55:49.330   00:55:51.090  
decompose   roles
maybe     you're  

00:55:51.090   00:55:51.100  
maybe you're a good   parent maybe you're
  

00:55:51.100   00:55:53.040  
maybe you're a good   parent maybe you're
a     good  

00:55:53.040   00:55:53.050  
a good employer or maybe you're   a good
  

00:55:53.050   00:55:55.230  
a good employer or maybe you're   a good
employee    sibling  

00:55:55.230   00:55:55.240  
employee   maybe you're a good sibling
  

00:55:55.240   00:55:56.880  
employee   maybe you're a good sibling
maybe     those  

00:55:56.880   00:55:56.890  
maybe you're a good child you know those
 

00:55:56.890   00:55:58.380  
maybe you're a good child you know those
are     major    your  

00:55:58.380   00:55:58.390  
are major   roles that you have in your
  

00:55:58.390   00:56:00.390  
are major   roles that you have in your
life     that  

00:56:00.390   00:56:00.400  
  life and so you'd say that
  

00:56:00.400   00:56:03.660  
  life and so you'd say that
what     about  

00:56:03.660   00:56:03.670  
what good person is is what's good about
 

00:56:03.670   00:56:05.670  
what good person is is what's good about
you     rules    a  

00:56:05.670   00:56:05.680  
you across all those rules   so it's a
  

00:56:05.680   00:56:08.160  
you across all those rules   so it's a
it's     a     abstraction  

00:56:08.160   00:56:08.170  
it's a   abstraction
  

00:56:08.170   00:56:09.600  
it's a   abstraction
from     then  

00:56:09.600   00:56:09.610  
  from something more concrete and then
  

00:56:09.610   00:56:12.840  
  from something more concrete and then
you     good  

00:56:12.840   00:56:12.850  
you can take the you know the   role good
  

00:56:12.850   00:56:16.140  
you can take the you know the   role good
parent    it  

00:56:16.140   00:56:16.150  
parent   what is it
  

00:56:16.150   00:56:17.940  
parent   what is it 
   you  

00:56:17.940   00:56:17.950  
  that constitutes a good parent and you
  

00:56:17.950   00:56:19.800  
  that constitutes a good parent and you
might     isn't  

00:56:19.800   00:56:19.810  
might say well a good parent this isn't
 

00:56:19.810   00:56:22.110  
might say well a good parent this isn't
exhaustive     obviously    a

   you know you
  

00:56:31.450   00:56:34.080  
   you know you
you     not     odd  

00:56:34.080   00:56:34.090  
you   too odd
  

00:56:34.090   00:56:36.360  
you   too odd
hopefully     can     and  

00:56:36.360   00:56:36.370  
hopefully you can   cook the odd meal and
  

00:56:36.370   00:56:38.880  
hopefully you can   cook the odd meal and
you     with     and  

00:56:38.880   00:56:38.890

the     maybe

200   like 
   you  

01:01:46.280   01:01:46.290  
  a lot but not an infinite number so you
  

01:01:46.290   01:01:47.840  
  a lot but not an infinite number so you
teach     and  

01:01:47.840   01:01:47.850  
teach them all   the micro routines and
  

01:01:47.850   01:01:50.960  
teach them all   the micro routines and 
   micro  

01:01:50.960   01:01:50.970  
  then you can say run set of micro
  

01:01:50.970   01:01:53.480  
  then you can say run set of micro
routines     and  

01:01:53.480   01:01:53.490  
routines which means   clean up room and
  

01:01:53.490   01:01:54.770  
routines which means   clean up room and
then     it  

01:01:54.770   01:01:54.780  
then they can do   it they know what it
  

01:01:54.780   01:01:57.230  
then they can do   it they know what it
means    from  

01:01:57.230   01:01:57.240  
means   so but you do the building from
  

01:01:57.240   01:01:58.790  
means   so but you do the building from 
   when  

01:01:58.790   01:01:58.800

reason   that this keeps chaos at bay is
  

01:04:14.480   01:04:16.660  
reason   that this keeps chaos at bay is
because     it     belief  

01:04:16.660   01:04:16.670  
because it   isn't because your belief
  

01:04:16.670   01:04:19.510  
because it   isn't because your belief
systems     bay     that  

01:04:19.510   01:04:19.520  
systems keep chaos at bay   it's not that
  

01:04:19.520   01:04:21.220  
systems keep chaos at bay   it's not that
abstract     things  

01:04:21.220   01:04:21.230  
abstract it's that if you do things
 

01:04:21.230   01:04:22.810  
abstract it's that if you do things
right   then  

01:04:22.810   01:04:22.820  
right   things right then
  

01:04:22.820   01:04:24.580  
right   things right then
terrible     to     less  

01:04:24.580   01:04:24.590  
terrible things happen to   less
  

01:04:24.590   01:04:26.560  
terrible things happen to   less
frequency     like  

01:04:26.560   01:04:26.570  
  frequency and that's not the psyche like
  

01:04:26.570   01:04:28.660  
  frequency and that's not the psyche like
it's     maybe  

01:04:28.660   01:04:28.670  
  it's partly psychological because maybe
  

01:04:28.670   01:04:30.070  
  it's partly psychological because maybe
you     not  

01:04:30.070   01:04:30.080  
you don't   fight as much maybe not
  

01:04:30.080   01:04:31.599  
you don't   fight as much maybe not
anxious     as  

01:04:31.599   01:04:31.609  
anxious   as much maybe you're not as
  

01:04:31.609   01:04:32.980  
anxious   as much maybe you're not as
depressed     of     just  

01:04:32.980   01:04:32.990  
depressed   it's just
  

01:04:32.990   01:04:35.590  
depressed   it's just
practical     know     if  

01:04:35.590   01:04:35.600  
practical   if
  

01:04:35.600   01:04:37.780

your kid   on
the     your  

01:04:40.180   01:04:40.190  
the stairs then you don't break   your
  

01:04:40.190   01:04:42.460  
the stairs then you don't break   your 
   just  

01:04:42.460   01:04:42.470  
   just
  

01:04:42.470   01:04:43.960  
   just
psychological     good  

01:04:43.960   01:04:43.970  
psychological that's actually a good
 

01:04:43.970   01:04:45.910  
psychological that's actually a good

  thing not to break your neck so often
  

01:04:45.920   01:04:48.609  
  thing not to break your neck so often
and    merely

something   that keeps things at bay
psychologically    here's  

01:04:54.730   01:04:54.740

01:06:27.800   01:06:27.810  
can't manage   the
  

01:06:27.810   01:06:29.060  
can't manage   the
sentence     do  

01:06:29.060   01:06:29.070  
sentence that   I've got and then I do
  

01:06:29.070   01:06:30.950  
sentence that   I've got and then I do
that     paragraph  

01:06:30.950   01:06:30.960  
that with   ten sentences in a paragraph
  

01:06:30.960   01:06:32.810  
that with   ten sentences in a paragraph
and     all  

01:06:32.810   01:06:32.820  
and I make   sure the sentences are all
  

01:06:32.820   01:06:34.520  
and I make   sure the sentences are all
arranged     properly     the  

01:06:34.520   01:06:34.530  
arranged properly   in the paragraph the
  

01:06:34.530   01:06:36.440  
arranged properly   in the paragraph the
same     rewriting     of  

01:06:36.440   01:06:36.450  
same way by rewriting   a bunch of
  

01:06:36.450   01:06:38.180  
same way by rewriting   a bunch of
different     to  

01:06:38.180   01:06:38.190  
different variants of   it and trying to
  

01:06:38.190   01:06:39.980  
different variants of   it and trying to
get     and  

01:06:39.980   01:06:39.990  
  get the word right in a phrase right and
  

01:06:39.990   01:06:41.300  
  get the word right in a phrase right and 
   sentence  

01:06:41.300   01:06:41.310  
   and the sentence
  

01:06:41.310   01:06:43.160  
   and the sentence
order     the     order  

01:06:43.160   01:06:43.170  
order right and the   paragraph order
  

01:06:43.170   01:06:45.800  
order right and the   paragraph order
right     right  

01:06:45.800   01:06:45.810  
right   and I can tell what it's right
  

01:06:45.810   01:06:47.810  
right   and I can tell what it's right
enough     any  

01:06:47.810   01:06:47.820  
enough because I can't make it   any
  

01:06:47.820   01:06:49.880  
enough because I can't make it   any
better    it  

01:06:49.880   01:06:49.890  
better   it
  

01:06:49.890   01:06:51.920  
better   it
just    I  

01:06:51.920   01:06:51.930  
just   and so I
  

01:06:51.930   01:06:53.480  
just   and so I
get     to     a  

01:06:53.480   01:06:53.490  
get   point where if I'm writing a
  

01:06:53.490   01:06:56.090  
get   point where if I'm writing a
paragraph     I  

01:06:56.090   01:06:56.100  
paragraph   and I write a variant and I
  

01:06:56.100   01:06:57.590  
paragraph   and I write a variant and I
can't     better  

01:06:57.590   01:06:57.600  
can't   tell if the variance is any better
  

01:06:57.600   01:06:59.480  
can't   tell if the variance is any better
and    I'd  

01:06:59.480   01:06:59.490  
and   than I'm done I'd
  

01:06:59.490   01:07:01.220  
and   than I'm done I'd
hit     the     intellectual  

01:07:01.220   01:07:01.230  
hit the   limit of my intellectual
  

01:07:01.230   01:07:03.860  
hit the   limit of my intellectual
capacity     time     but  

01:07:03.860   01:07:03.870  
capacity   move on but
  

01:07:03.870   01:07:06.140  
capacity   move on but
then     the  

01:07:06.140   01:07:06.150  
then but you know that it   isn't like the
  

01:07:06.150   01:07:08.690  
then but you know that it   isn't like the
essay     a  

01:07:08.690   01:07:08.700  
essay   that I'm writing let's say has a
  

01:07:08.700   01:07:11.360  
essay   that I'm writing let's say has a
boundary     the  

01:07:11.360   01:07:11.370  
boundary   it's tightly drawn around the
  

01:07:11.370   01:07:12.620  
boundary   it's tightly drawn around the
essay    I'm  

01:07:12.620   01:07:12.630  
essay   because there's a reason I'm
  

01:07:12.630   01:07:14.240  
essay   because there's a reason I'm
writing     be  

01:07:14.240   01:07:14.250  
  writing the damn essay and that would be
  

01:07:14.250   01:07:16.340  
  writing the damn essay and that would be
well     trying     a  

01:07:16.340   01:07:16.350  
well I'm trying   a
  

01:07:16.350   01:07:18.290  
well I'm trying   a
whole     to  

01:07:18.290   01:07:18.300  
  whole manuscript hopefully I'm trying to
  

01:07:18.300   01:07:19.790  
  whole manuscript hopefully I'm trying to
address     important     why  

01:07:19.790   01:07:19.800  
address   problem because why
  

01:07:19.800   01:07:22.220  
address   problem because why
would     be     mean  

01:07:22.220   01:07:22.230  
would I be   I mean
  

01:07:22.230   01:07:24.170  
would I be   I mean 
   maybe  

01:07:24.170   01:07:24.180  
  that'd be kind of pointless and maybe
  

01:07:24.180   01:07:26.180  
  that'd be kind of pointless and maybe
that's     scientist  

01:07:26.180   01:07:26.190  
that's part   of my role as a scientist
  

01:07:26.190   01:07:28.340  
that's part   of my role as a scientist
and     a  

01:07:28.340   01:07:28.350  
and that's a subset   of my role as a
  

01:07:28.350   01:07:30.290  
and that's a subset   of my role as a
professor     and     my  

01:07:30.290   01:07:30.300  
professor and   then that's a subset of my
  

01:07:30.300   01:07:32.480  
professor and   then that's a subset of my 
   then  

01:07:32.480   01:07:32.490  
  role as a productive citizen and then
  

01:07:32.490   01:07:36.080  
  role as a productive citizen and then
that's     someone  

01:07:36.080   01:07:36.090  
that's a subset   of my role of someone
  

01:07:36.090   01:07:38.780  
that's a subset   of my role of someone 
   that's  

01:07:38.780   01:07:38.790  
   see and that's
  

01:07:38.790   01:07:42.680  
   see and that's
why     that's     the  

01:07:42.680   01:07:42.690  
why the logos is the thing that's   at the
  

01:07:42.690   01:07:44.480  
why the logos is the thing that's   at the 
   the  

01:07:44.480   01:07:44.490  
   that's how the
  

01:07:44.490   01:07:45.950  
   that's how the
hierarchy     be     that  

01:07:45.950   01:07:45.960  
hierarchy   that
  

01:07:45.960   01:07:48.890  
hierarchy   that
everything     see     because  

01:07:48.890   01:07:48.900  
everything else should   because
  

01:07:48.900   01:07:50.270  
everything else should   because
you     well  

01:07:50.270   01:07:50.280  
you have a   structure do you think well
  

01:07:50.280   01:07:51.710  
you have a   structure do you think well 
   subordinate  

01:07:51.710   01:07:51.720  
  what should the structure be subordinate
  

01:07:51.720   01:07:53.750  
  what should the structure be subordinate
to     should     be  

01:07:53.750   01:07:53.760  
to and then the answer should   be
  

01:07:53.760   01:07:55.520  
to and then the answer should   be
something     be  

01:07:55.520   01:07:55.530  
something like the structure should   be
  

01:07:55.530   01:07:56.960  
something like the structure should   be
subordinate    that  

01:07:56.960   01:07:56.970  
subordinate   to the process that
  

01:07:56.970   01:07:59.720  
subordinate   to the process that
generates     the     structure  

01:07:59.720   01:07:59.730  
generates the structure or the   structure
  

01:07:59.730   01:08:01.220  
generates the structure or the   structure
should    process  

01:08:01.220   01:08:01.230  
should   subordinate to the process
  

01:08:01.230   01:08:02.780  
should   subordinate to the process 
   the  

01:08:02.780   01:08:02.790  
  that generates and maintains the
  

01:08:02.790   01:08:05.630  
  that generates and maintains the
structure     well     be  

01:08:05.630   01:08:05.640  
structure well   it be
  

01:08:05.640   01:08:07.340  
structure well   it be
any    is  

01:08:07.340   01:08:07.350  
any   unless the structure is
  

01:08:07.350   01:08:09.440  
any   unless the structure is
perfect     you  

01:08:09.440   01:08:09.450  
perfect with the in which case you
 

01:08:09.450   01:08:11.180  
perfect with the in which case you
   generates  

01:08:11.180   01:08:11.190  
  dispensed with the thing that generates
  

01:08:11.190   01:08:12.860  
  dispensed with the thing that generates
it     a  

01:08:12.860   01:08:12.870  
it and improves it but then you're a
 

01:08:12.870   01:08:14.660  
it and improves it but then you're a
totalitarian     the 

01:08:14.660   01:08:14.670  
totalitarian it's like hey we got the
 

01:08:14.670   01:08:17.390  
totalitarian it's like hey we got the
answer   are  

01:08:17.390   01:08:17.400  
answer   you don't people are
  

01:08:17.400   01:08:19.340  
answer   you don't people are
still    dying  

01:08:19.340   01:08:19.350  
still   still dying
  

01:08:19.350   01:08:21.790  
still   still dying 
   answer  

01:08:21.790   01:08:21.800  
   damn answer
  

01:08:21.800   01:08:23.500  
   damn answer
and     have     that  

01:08:23.500   01:08:23.510  
and so maybe   an answer that
  

01:08:23.510   01:08:25.240  
and so maybe   an answer that 
   much  

01:08:25.240   01:08:25.250  
   as much
  

01:08:25.250   01:08:26.770  
   as much
suffering     be  

01:08:26.770   01:08:26.780  
suffering   and dying as there could be
  

01:08:26.780   01:08:29.410  
suffering   and dying as there could be
but     there's     be  

01:08:29.410   01:08:29.420  
but there's   road to be
  

01:08:29.420   01:08:32.770  
but there's   road to be 
   perfect  

01:08:32.770   01:08:32.780  
  traveled yet and so it all makes perfect
  

01:08:32.780   01:08:35.800  
  traveled yet and so it all makes perfect 
   should  

01:08:35.800   01:08:35.810  
   be should
  

01:08:35.810   01:08:39.460

be nested within   this highest sigh think
  

01:08:39.470   01:08:41.110  
be nested within   this highest sigh think
of     of  

01:08:41.110   01:08:41.120  
of it sort of   as the highest order of
  

01:08:41.120   01:08:43.780  
of it sort of   as the highest order of
moral     gives  

01:08:43.780   01:08:43.790  
  moral striving and then that also gives
  

01:08:43.790   01:08:46.000  
  moral striving and then that also gives
you     most  

01:08:46.000   01:08:46.010  
you moral hierarchy   that's the most
  

01:08:46.010   01:08:48.670  
you moral hierarchy   that's the most
important     with     honor  

01:08:48.670   01:08:48.680  
important   honor
  

01:08:48.680   01:08:50.590  
important   honor 
   and  

01:08:50.590   01:08:50.600  
  speech you do that with the tension and
  

01:08:50.600   01:08:52.710  
  speech you do that with the tension and
honest     and  

01:08:52.710   01:08:52.720  
honest speech that's how you do   that and
  

01:08:52.720   01:08:56.500  
honest speech that's how you do   that and
you     this  

01:08:56.500   01:08:56.510  
you   don't sacrifice that to any of this
  

01:08:56.510   01:08:59.470  
you   don't sacrifice that to any of this 
   you're  

01:08:59.470   01:08:59.480  
  because if you do then then you're
  

01:08:59.480   01:09:01.570  
  because if you do then then you're
hurting     idea  

01:09:01.570   01:09:01.580  
hurting   your soul it's there's this idea
  

01:09:01.580   01:09:03.520  
hurting   your soul it's there's this idea 
   sin  

01:09:03.520   01:09:03.530  
  in the New Testament that the sin
  

01:09:03.530   01:09:05.230  
  in the New Testament that the sin
against     sin  

01:09:05.230   01:09:05.240  
against the Holy Ghost is   the one sin
  

01:09:05.240   01:09:06.910  
against the Holy Ghost is   the one sin 
   what  

01:09:06.910   01:09:06.920  
   no one knows what
  

01:09:06.920   01:09:08.380  
   no one knows what
the     maybe     doesn't  

01:09:08.380   01:09:08.390  
the hell that   it doesn't
  

01:09:08.390   01:09:09.130  
the hell that   it doesn't 
   anything  

01:09:09.130   01:09:09.140  
  mean anything
  

01:09:09.140   01:09:11.170  
  mean anything
but     is  

01:09:11.170   01:09:11.180  
but I   think this is what it means is
  

01:09:11.180   01:09:15.280  
but I   think this is what it means is
that     all  

01:09:15.280   01:09:15.290  
that because   this process generates all
  

01:09:15.290   01:09:19.840  
that because   this process generates all
this     then  

01:09:19.840   01:09:19.850  
this   if you violate that process then
  

01:09:19.850   01:09:22.210  
this   if you violate that process then
there's     hope     that's  

01:09:22.210   01:09:22.220  
there's no hope   you because that's
  

01:09:22.220   01:09:24.160  
there's no hope   you because that's
the     improve  

01:09:24.160   01:09:24.170  
  the process by which you improve
  

01:09:24.170   01:09:26.470  
  the process by which you improve
yourself     and     everything  

01:09:26.470   01:09:26.480  
   to everything
  

01:09:26.480   01:09:28.270  
   to everything
else     going  

01:09:28.270   01:09:28.280  
else   so if you decide you're not going
  

01:09:28.280   01:09:30.250  
else   so if you decide you're not going
to     it's     there's  

01:09:30.250   01:09:30.260  
to engage   like well there's
  

01:09:30.260   01:09:32.320  
to engage   like well there's
no     fixing     blown  

01:09:32.320   01:09:32.330  
no fixing   that because you've blown
  

01:09:32.330   01:09:34.330  
no fixing   that because you've blown
apart     thing  

01:09:34.330   01:09:34.340  
apart your relationship with the thing
 

01:09:34.340   01:09:39.850  
apart your relationship with the thing
   so  

01:09:39.850   01:09:39.860  
   so
  

01:09:39.860   01:09:41.770  
   so
that's     so  

01:09:41.770   01:09:41.780  
that's how you keep chaos at bay   and so
  

01:09:41.780   01:09:43.660  
that's how you keep chaos at bay   and so
part     that     because  

01:09:43.660   01:09:43.670  
part of that   is structural right because
  

01:09:43.670   01:09:46.270  
part of that   is structural right because
you     how     or  

01:09:46.270   01:09:46.280  
you know   to do these things more or
  

01:09:46.280   01:09:48.400  
you know   to do these things more or
less     you  

01:09:48.400   01:09:48.410  
  less it's part of your skill set if you
  

01:09:48.410   01:09:49.630  
  less it's part of your skill set if you
happen     writer     build  

01:09:49.630   01:09:49.640

   why in

01:10:00.430   01:10:00.440  
in the judeo-christian tradition   there's

in the judeo-christian tradition   there's

01:10:51.839   01:10:51.849  
  you can possibly manage right because it

  you can possibly manage right because it
actually     out     sub

actually   that the more the sub
  

01:10:54.670   01:10:56.310  
actually   that the more the sub
structures     better     because  

01:10:56.310   01:10:56.320  
structures differ the better   because
  

01:10:56.320   01:10:57.719  
structures differ the better   because
then     something  

01:10:57.719   01:10:57.729  
then you know   you can be doing something
  

01:10:57.729   01:10:59.459  
then you know   you can be doing something 
   good  

01:10:59.459   01:10:59.469  
   me that would be good
  

01:10:59.469   01:11:00.870  
   me that would be good

   thing
  

01:11:00.880   01:11:02.609  
   thing
then     if  

01:11:02.609   01:11:02.619  
then it's just duplication of   labor if
  

01:11:02.619   01:11:04.649  
then it's just duplication of   labor if
we     on     order  

01:11:04.649   01:11:04.659  
we could agree on   the higher order
  

01:11:04.659   01:11:06.449  
we could agree on   the higher order
principle     specialize     the  

01:11:06.449   01:11:06.459  
principle and then specialize   that the
  

01:11:06.459   01:11:09.180  
principle and then specialize   that the
lower     you  

01:11:09.180   01:11:09.190  
lower order levels it's like that's you
 

01:11:09.190   01:11:10.830  
lower order levels it's like that's you
get     have    and  

01:11:10.830   01:11:10.840  
get to have   it too and
  

01:11:10.840   01:11:16.350  
get to have   it too and
that    and  

01:11:16.350   01:11:16.360  
that   and
  

01:11:16.360   01:11:18.359  
that   and
so     rule     if  

01:11:18.359   01:11:18.369  
so then another rule   of thumb is if
  

01:11:18.369   01:11:19.919  
so then another rule   of thumb is if 
   solve

01:11:38.160   01:11:38.170  
because abstraction is very very
 

01:11:38.170   01:11:39.989  
because abstraction is very very
   very  

01:11:39.989   01:11:39.999

market crashed the reason it crashed was
 

01:11:46.539   01:11:48.509  
market crashed the reason it crashed was
because     of    derivatives  

01:11:48.509   01:11:48.519  
because of strange use of   derivatives
  

01:11:48.519   01:11:50.279  
because of strange use of   derivatives
and     like     order  

01:11:50.279   01:11:50.289  
and derivatives   higher order
  

01:11:50.289   01:11:52.109  
and derivatives   higher order
abstractions     and  

01:11:52.109   01:11:52.119  
abstractions in the financial world   and
  

01:11:52.119   01:11:54.390  
abstractions in the financial world   and
derivatives     tremendous  

01:11:54.390   01:11:54.400  
derivatives give you   tremendous
  

01:11:54.400   01:11:57.600  
derivatives give you   tremendous
financial     huge

financial   leverage and power with huge

financial   leverage and power with huge
risk     massive  

01:12:00.569   01:12:00.579  
risk   and so the upside is massive
  

01:12:00.579   01:12:02.069  
risk   and so the upside is massive
absolutely     can  

01:12:02.069   01:12:02.079  
absolutely massive because   you can
  

01:12:02.079   01:12:03.959  
absolutely massive because   you can
multiply     downside  

01:12:03.959   01:12:03.969  
multiply   your earnings but the downside
  

01:12:03.969   01:12:06.799  
multiply   your earnings but the downside 
   so  

01:12:06.799   01:12:06.809  
  is complete bloody catastrophe and so
  

01:12:06.809   01:12:09.600  
  is complete bloody catastrophe and so

conservative ethos is is solve the

01:12:20.949   01:12:22.259  
level of   resolution it's safer and it's
more     likely     a  

01:12:22.259   01:12:22.269  
more   to actually produce a

more   to actually produce a

01:12:27.579   01:12:29.850  
solution   now so now you're in your
plan     to  

01:12:29.850   01:12:29.860  
plan now we're simplified again just to
 

01:12:29.860   01:12:31.500  
plan now we're simplified again just to
one     little    other

think   are
but     case     all  

01:12:48.910   01:12:48.920  
but that's not the case   all
  

01:12:48.920   01:12:50.620  
but that's not the case   all
most    encounter  

01:12:50.620   01:12:50.630  
most   you encounter
  

01:12:50.630   01:12:51.940  
most   you encounter
many    other  

01:12:51.940   01:12:51.950  
many   of the things are actually other
  

01:12:51.950   01:12:53.530  
many   of the things are actually other
people     objects     they're  

01:12:53.530   01:12:53.540  
people and they're not   they're

   from the
  

01:12:57.110   01:12:58.840  
   from the
social     things     you  

01:12:58.840   01:12:58.850  
social world   that you
  

01:12:58.850   01:13:01.030  
social world   that you
encounter     be  

01:13:01.030   01:13:01.040  
encounter aren't objects they seem to be
 

01:13:01.040   01:13:03.100  
encounter aren't objects they seem to be
   obstacles  

01:13:03.100   01:13:03.110  
   tools or obstacles
  

01:13:03.110   01:13:05.290  
   tools or obstacles 
   and  

01:13:05.290   01:13:05.300  
   that we see objects and
  

01:13:05.300   01:13:07.210  
   that we see objects and
turn     mean  

01:13:07.210   01:13:07.220  
turn them into tools or obstacles I mean
 

01:13:07.220   01:13:09.160  
turn them into tools or obstacles I mean
that     tools    because  

01:13:09.160   01:13:09.170  
that we see tools   and obstacles because
  

01:13:09.170   01:13:11.110  
that we see tools   and obstacles because 
   array  

01:13:11.110   01:13:11.120  
  what happens is that when you array
  

01:13:11.120   01:13:15.610  
  what happens is that when you array
yourself     world  

01:13:15.610   01:13:15.620  
yourself towards a goal then the world
 

01:13:15.620   01:13:17.920  
yourself towards a goal then the world
transforms     into    get  

01:13:17.920   01:13:17.930  
transforms itself into   things that get
  

01:13:17.930   01:13:19.180  
transforms itself into   things that get
in     way     that  

01:13:19.180   01:13:19.190  
in the way   of that goal and things that
  

01:13:19.190   01:13:21.100  
in the way   of that goal and things that 
   way  

01:13:21.100   01:13:21.110  
  three things things are get in the way
  

01:13:21.110   01:13:23.080  
  three things things are get in the way
of    you  

01:13:23.080   01:13:23.090  
of   things those are things you
  

01:13:23.090   01:13:25.390  
of   things those are things you
don't     your  

01:13:25.390   01:13:25.400  
don't like things that facilitate your
 

01:13:25.400   01:13:27.220  
don't like things that facilitate your
movement     the    are  

01:13:27.220   01:13:27.230  
movement towards the   goal those are
  

01:13:27.230   01:13:29.200  
movement towards the   goal those are
things     irrelevant  

01:13:29.200   01:13:29.210  
things that you   like and the irrelevant
  

01:13:29.210   01:13:31.510  
things that you   like and the irrelevant
things     irrelevant  

01:13:31.510   01:13:31.520  
things   and mostly you want irrelevant
  

01:13:31.520   01:13:32.890  
things   and mostly you want irrelevant
things     damn  

01:13:32.890   01:13:32.900  
things because there's just   too damn
  

01:13:32.900   01:13:34.840  
things because there's just   too damn
many     of  

01:13:34.840   01:13:34.850  
  many things so the category of
  

01:13:34.850   01:13:37.090  
  many things so the category of 
   so  

01:13:37.090   01:13:37.100  
   so
  

01:13:37.100   01:13:39.250  
   so
most     thing     is  

01:13:39.250   01:13:39.260  
most the thing   most of everything is
  

01:13:39.260   01:13:41.410  
most the thing   most of everything is
irrelevant     plan     few  

01:13:41.410   01:13:41.420  
irrelevant   a few
  

01:13:41.420   01:13:42.790  
irrelevant   a few
things     because     you  

01:13:42.790   01:13:42.800  
things are good   they move you
  

01:13:42.800   01:13:44.620  
things are good   they move you
forward     so  

01:13:44.620   01:13:44.630  
forward and   some other things are not so
  

01:13:44.630   01:13:46.450  
forward and   some other things are not so
good    so  

01:13:46.450   01:13:46.460  
good   so
  

01:13:46.460   01:13:47.830  
good   so
good    them  

01:13:47.830   01:13:47.840  
   if you can manage them
  

01:13:47.840   01:13:49.780  
   if you can manage them
unless     into  

01:13:49.780   01:13:49.790  
unless   you like to run head forth into
  

01:13:49.790   01:13:51.250  
unless   you like to run head forth into
like     not  

01:13:51.250   01:13:51.260  
like brick walls which   is not
  

01:13:51.260   01:13:53.620  
like brick walls which   is not
particularly    but  

01:13:53.620   01:13:53.630  
particularly   so learning experience but
  

01:13:53.630   01:13:55.930  
particularly   so learning experience but
I     repeat     you  

01:13:55.930   01:13:55.940  
I   you
  

01:13:55.940   01:13:58.330  
I   you
want     itself  

01:13:58.330   01:13:58.340  
want you want the world to array itself
 

01:13:58.340   01:14:01.990  
want you want the world to array itself
   what  

01:14:01.990   01:14:02.000  
  as a set of we could say tools now what
  

01:14:02.000   01:14:03.850  
  as a set of we could say tools now what
happens     is     perceptual  

01:14:03.850   01:14:03.860  
happens is   that you have this perceptual
  

01:14:03.860   01:14:05.980  
happens is   that you have this perceptual
system     it's  

01:14:05.980   01:14:05.990  
system that's mediated by dopamine it's
 

01:14:05.990   01:14:08.080  
system that's mediated by dopamine it's
the     same    activates  

01:14:08.080   01:14:08.090  
the same   system that cocaine activates
  

01:14:08.090   01:14:09.970  
the same   system that cocaine activates
or     that  

01:14:09.970   01:14:09.980  
or   methamphetamine or the drugs that
  

01:14:09.980   01:14:12.220  
or   methamphetamine or the drugs that 
   the  

01:14:12.220   01:14:12.230  
   to take and it's the
  

01:14:12.230   01:14:14.890  
   to take and it's the
dopaminergic     that     with  

01:14:14.890   01:14:14.900  
dopaminergic system that   responds with
  

01:14:14.900   01:14:16.810  
dopaminergic system that   responds with
positive     emotion     that  

01:14:16.810   01:14:16.820  
positive emotion   to indications that
  

01:14:16.820   01:14:18.010  
positive emotion   to indications that
you've     something     will  

01:14:18.010   01:14:18.020  
you've encountered something   that will
  

01:14:18.020   01:14:19.660  
you've encountered something   that will
facilitate     goal  

01:14:19.660   01:14:19.670  
facilitate   your movement towards a goal
  

01:14:19.670   01:14:22.300  
facilitate   your movement towards a goal
and     know  

01:14:22.300   01:14:22.310  
and that's really important   to know
  

01:14:22.310   01:14:24.370  
and that's really important   to know
because     to     that  

01:14:24.370   01:14:24.380  
because   think that
  

01:14:24.380   01:14:26.110  
because   think that
they're     goals  

01:14:26.110   01:14:26.120  
they're   happy because they achieve goals
  

01:14:26.120   01:14:28.540  
they're   happy because they achieve goals
and     that's     it  

01:14:28.540   01:14:28.550  
and that's   not true what's true it
  

01:14:28.550   01:14:29.800  
and that's   not true what's true it
because     soon     goal  

01:14:29.800   01:14:29.810  
because as   as you achieve a goal
  

01:14:29.810   01:14:31.150  
because as   as you achieve a goal
then     a     what's  

01:14:31.150   01:14:31.160  
then you have a   problem which is what's
  

01:14:31.160   01:14:33.070  
then you have a   problem which is what's 
   big  

01:14:33.070   01:14:33.080  
   big
  

01:14:33.080   01:14:34.660

you graduate   university for example
  

01:14:36.500   01:14:37.000  
you graduate   university for example 
   right  

01:14:37.000   01:14:37.010  
  it's right
  

01:14:37.010   01:14:40.450  
  it's right

01:14:50.260   01:14:50.270  
Starbucks employee   right so it's like so
  

01:14:50.270   01:14:54.250  
Starbucks employee   right so it's like so
obviously     a  

01:14:54.250   01:14:54.260  
obviously the accomplishment per se as a
 

01:14:54.260   01:14:56.740  
obviously the accomplishment per se as a
source     problematic 

01:14:56.740   01:14:56.750  
source of reward is is problematic
 

01:14:56.750   01:14:59.920  
source of reward is is problematic
because     you    the  

01:14:59.920   01:14:59.930  
because when you   accomplish you run the
  

01:14:59.930   01:15:00.910  
because when you   accomplish you run the 
   its  

01:15:00.910   01:15:00.920  
  frame to its
  

01:15:00.920   01:15:02.560  
  frame to its
and     problem     needing  

01:15:02.560   01:15:02.570  
and then you have the problem   of needing
  

01:15:02.570   01:15:04.990  
and then you have the problem   of needing
a     frame     if  

01:15:04.990   01:15:05.000  
a new frame   problem but if
  

01:15:05.000   01:15:06.820  
a new frame   problem but if
what     are  

01:15:06.820   01:15:06.830  
what   you're encountering instead are
  

01:15:06.830   01:15:08.709  
what   you're encountering instead are
things     way  

01:15:08.709   01:15:08.719  
things   that will move you along your way
  

01:15:08.719   01:15:10.570  
things   that will move you along your way 
   that's  

01:15:10.570   01:15:10.580  
   great and that's
  

01:15:10.580   01:15:12.340  
   great and that's
where     motivation  

01:15:12.340   01:15:12.350  
where you get   your positive motivation
  

01:15:12.350   01:15:14.740  
where you get   your positive motivation
and     that's     so  

01:15:14.740   01:15:14.750  
and so that's   really thinking that's so
  

01:15:14.750   01:15:16.479  
and so that's   really thinking that's so 
   think  

01:15:16.479   01:15:16.489  
  much we're thinking about you can think
  

01:15:16.489   01:15:18.040  
  much we're thinking about you can think
about     year     wouldn't  

01:15:18.040   01:15:18.050  
   that wouldn't
  

01:15:18.050   01:15:19.419  
   that wouldn't
even     because  

01:15:19.419   01:15:19.429  
even   be enough to think about it because
  

01:15:19.429   01:15:21.610  
even   be enough to think about it because
here's     some  

01:15:21.610   01:15:21.620  
here's what it means   it means in some
  

01:15:21.620   01:15:23.200  
here's what it means   it means in some
sense     that     with  

01:15:23.200   01:15:23.210  
sense that   the Buddhists are right with
  

01:15:23.210   01:15:24.310  
sense that   the Buddhists are right with
their     about     Maya  

01:15:24.310   01:15:24.320  
their claim about   Maya
  

01:15:24.320   01:15:27.070  
their claim about   Maya
mnya     an  

01:15:27.070   01:15:27.080

  mnya which means that people live in an

01:15:28.870   01:15:28.880  
   and what they mean by that is
  

01:15:28.880   01:15:31.660  
   and what they mean by that is
well    is  

01:15:31.660   01:15:31.670  
well   your goal is
  

01:15:31.670   01:15:34.689  
well   your goal is 
   the  

01:15:34.689   01:15:34.699  
  and that goal gives relevance to the
  

01:15:34.699   01:15:36.970  
  and that goal gives relevance to the
world     could     relevance  

01:15:36.970   01:15:36.980  
world and you   change the relevance
  

01:15:36.980   01:15:39.070  
world and you   change the relevance
of     changing  

01:15:39.070   01:15:39.080  
of the world in a snap   just by changing
  

01:15:39.080   01:15:42.130  
of the world in a snap   just by changing 
   then  

01:15:42.130   01:15:42.140  
  your goal you can do that and so then
  

01:15:42.140   01:15:43.390  
  your goal you can do that and so then
you    illusion  

01:15:43.390   01:15:43.400  
you   of an illusion
  

01:15:43.400   01:15:45.700  
you   of an illusion 
   you  

01:15:45.700   01:15:45.710  
   change it now you
  

01:15:45.710   01:15:46.750  
   change it now you
don't     of  

01:15:46.750   01:15:46.760  
don't want to push that line of
 

01:15:46.760   01:15:49.630  
don't want to push that line of
argumentation     if 

01:15:49.630   01:15:49.640  
argumentation too far because even if
 

01:15:49.640   01:15:53.680  
argumentation too far because even if
the   the  

01:15:53.680   01:15:53.690  
the   the
  

01:15:53.690   01:15:55.090  
the   the
fact    frames  

01:15:55.090   01:15:55.100  
fact   these frames
  

01:15:55.100   01:15:57.970  
fact   these frames
cannot     be  

01:15:57.970   01:15:57.980  
cannot be changed   and so you have to be
  

01:15:57.980   01:15:59.320  
cannot be changed   and so you have to be
in     frame     the  

01:15:59.320   01:15:59.330  
in a frame   the
  

01:15:59.330   01:16:01.150  
in a frame   the
frame     still     there  

01:16:01.150   01:16:01.160  
   there
  

01:16:01.160   01:16:02.200  
   there
which     the  

01:16:02.200   01:16:02.210  
which is   that you have to be in the
  

01:16:02.210   01:16:04.570  
which is   that you have to be in the
frame     absolute  

01:16:04.570   01:16:04.580  
frame and that is not a trivial absolute
 

01:16:04.580   01:16:06.640  
frame and that is not a trivial absolute
it's     very    absolute  

01:16:06.640   01:16:06.650  
it's a very it's a very   major absolute
  

01:16:06.650   01:16:08.860  
it's a very it's a very   major absolute
so     okay     your  

01:16:08.860   01:16:08.870  
so then you   all of your
  

01:16:08.870   01:16:10.450  
so then you   all of your 
   be  

01:16:10.450   01:16:10.460  
   going to be
  

01:16:10.460   01:16:12.630  
   going to be
experienced     goal  

01:16:12.630   01:16:12.640  
experienced in relationship to the goal
 

01:16:12.640   01:16:14.950  
experienced in relationship to the goal
well     we    use  

01:16:14.950   01:16:14.960  
well then we   think well you could use
  

01:16:14.960   01:16:17.290  
well then we   think well you could use
some    thing

like     well     of  

01:16:48.280   01:16:48.290  
like well   you could say the same sort of
  

01:16:48.290   01:16:49.959  
like well   you could say the same sort of 
   things  

01:16:49.959   01:16:49.969  
  cynical thing about most of the things
  

01:16:49.969   01:16:51.970  
  cynical thing about most of the things
that     you     the  

01:16:51.970   01:16:51.980  
   the
  

01:16:51.980   01:16:53.500  
   the
silikal     they  

01:16:53.500   01:16:53.510  
silikal thing   about the fact that they
  

01:16:53.510   01:16:56.800  
silikal thing   about the fact that they
have     you     have

a point you   have your
ambition     what     the  

01:17:01.450   01:17:01.460  
ambition and then that's what   turns the
  

01:17:01.460   01:17:03.280  
ambition and then that's what   turns the 
   place  

01:17:03.280   01:17:03.290  
   positive place
  

01:17:03.290   01:17:06.340  
   positive place
and     cool  

01:17:06.340   01:17:06.350  
and here's the kicker   this is so cool
  

01:17:06.350   01:17:08.680  
and here's the kicker   this is so cool
the     the  

01:17:08.680   01:17:08.690  
the higher they aim the more the
 

01:17:08.690   01:17:12.189  
the higher they aim the more the
positive     that's    you  

01:17:12.189   01:17:12.199  
positive emotion so that's   that you
  

01:17:12.199   01:17:14.180  
positive emotion so that's   that you
think     you  

01:17:14.180   01:17:14.190  
think well why should I bother   you
  

01:17:14.190   01:17:15.590

why should I bother doing   something
  

01:17:15.600   01:17:19.010  
why should I bother doing   something
lofty     because  

01:17:19.010   01:17:19.020  
lofty and difficult it's like because
 

01:17:19.020   01:17:23.660  
lofty and difficult it's like because
   the  

01:17:23.660   01:17:23.670  
  it's worth it that's why because the
  

01:17:23.670   01:17:26.630  
  it's worth it that's why because the
alternative     because  

01:17:26.630   01:17:26.640  
  alternative is stupid suffering because
  

01:17:26.640   01:17:28.490  
  alternative is stupid suffering because
really     is  

01:17:28.490   01:17:28.500  
really really because what happens is

   that's the
easy    you  

01:17:42.470   01:17:42.480  
easy   if you

that   and that's not so 
   for

you get something   called combinatorial 
   so  

01:19:45.650   01:19:45.660  
   and it means that there's so
  

01:19:45.660   01:19:47.570  
   and it means that there's so
many     so  

01:19:47.570   01:19:47.580  
many variables   you just can't predict so

  the darkness and so Geppetto makes an
agreement     says  

01:22:38.060   01:22:38.070

  things a little better everywhere you
  

01:23:51.930   01:23:53.180  
  things a little better everywhere you
went     would  

01:23:53.180   01:23:53.190  
went it's like the universe   would
  

01:23:53.190   01:23:53.600  
went it's like the universe   would
probably 

01:23:53.600   01:23:53.610  
probably
 

01:23:53.610   01:23:55.880  
probably
   you  

01:23:55.880   01:23:55.890  
   you
  

01:23:55.890   01:23:57.200  
   you
could     away     of  

01:23:57.200   01:23:57.210  
could get   with it if you're sort of
  

01:23:57.210   01:24:01.340  
could get   with it if you're sort of
quiet     it     okay  

01:24:01.340   01:24:01.350  
   okay
  

01:24:01.350   01:24:03.650  
   okay
so     your  

01:24:03.650   01:24:03.660  
so then once you've established your
 

01:24:03.660   01:24:05.630  
so then once you've established your
your     you    then  

01:24:05.630   01:24:05.640  
your target you know where you   are then
  

01:24:05.640   01:24:07.730  
your target you know where you   are then 
   because  

01:24:07.730   01:24:07.740  
  you know what's good for you because
  

01:24:07.740   01:24:09.920  
  you know what's good for you because 
   at  

01:24:09.920   01:24:09.930  
  that moves you along and that happens at
  

01:24:09.930   01:24:11.210  
  that moves you along and that happens at
a     perceptual     to  

01:24:11.210   01:24:11.220  
a perceptual   have to
  

01:24:11.220   01:24:12.980  
a perceptual   have to
think    the  

01:24:12.980   01:24:12.990  
think   and the
  

01:24:12.990   01:24:14.330  
think   and the
experimental     that's  

01:24:14.330   01:24:14.340  
experimental literature   and that's
  

01:24:14.340   01:24:16.910  
experimental literature   and that's
already     I  

01:24:16.910   01:24:16.920  
already quite clear so for example if   I
  

01:24:16.920   01:24:20.440  
already quite clear so for example if   I
specify     podium     my  

01:24:20.440   01:24:20.450  
specify   as the target for my
  

01:24:20.450   01:24:22.850  
specify   as the target for my
action     I'm     I'm  

01:24:22.850   01:24:22.860  
action   happy when I'm
  

01:24:22.860   01:24:24.380  
action   happy when I'm
walking     is  

01:24:24.380   01:24:24.390  
walking towards   it because there it is
  

01:24:24.390   01:24:25.970  
walking towards   it because there it is
and     nicely  

01:24:25.970   01:24:25.980  
and everything cooperating really nicely
 

01:24:25.980   01:24:30.110  
and everything cooperating really nicely
   sign  

01:24:30.110   01:24:30.120  
  but if I specify going to the exit sign
  

01:24:30.120   01:24:32.690  
  but if I specify going to the exit sign
that     that's     that  

01:24:32.690   01:24:32.700  
that you guys can't see that's   the that
  

01:24:32.700   01:24:34.970  
that you guys can't see that's   the that
that     this     of  

01:24:34.970   01:24:34.980  
that this   in the front of
  

01:24:34.980   01:24:37.010  
that this   in the front of
then     then  

01:24:37.010   01:24:37.020  
then as soon   as I specify that then
  

01:24:37.020   01:24:39.620  
then as soon   as I specify that then
that's     that's  

01:24:39.620   01:24:39.630  
that's   an annoying obstacle and that's
  

01:24:39.630   01:24:42.080  
that's   an annoying obstacle and that's
precognitive     happens     immediately  

01:24:42.080   01:24:42.090  
precognitive it just happens   immediately
  

01:24:42.090   01:24:44.570  
precognitive it just happens   immediately
it     it  

01:24:44.570   01:24:44.580  
it happens instantaneously   and so it
  

01:24:44.580   01:24:47.300  
it happens instantaneously   and so it 
   you're  

01:24:47.300   01:24:47.310  
   that you you you're
  

01:24:47.310   01:24:50.390  
   that you you you're
you're     inside  

01:24:50.390   01:24:50.400  
you're being manifests itself inside
 

01:24:50.400   01:24:52.550  
you're being manifests itself inside
these     about 

01:24:52.550   01:24:52.560  
these frames and so what's so cool about
 

01:24:52.560   01:24:54.440  
these frames and so what's so cool about
   it  

01:24:54.440   01:24:54.450  
   it
  

01:24:54.450   01:24:56.480  
   it
doesn't     planets  

01:24:56.480   01:24:56.490  
doesn't mean you can like juggle planets
 

01:24:56.490   01:24:58.400  
doesn't mean you can like juggle planets
or     like    give  

01:24:58.400   01:24:58.410  
or anything like   it does give
  

01:24:58.410   01:25:03.590  
or anything like   it does give
you     what     trammeled  

01:25:03.590   01:25:03.600  
you quite a scope of what   I'm trammeled
  

01:25:03.600   01:25:05.420  
you quite a scope of what   I'm trammeled
action     the     frame

action   frame
  

01:25:05.430   01:25:06.980  
action   frame
isn't     it  

01:25:06.980   01:25:06.990  
isn't   working out then you can tweak it
  

01:25:06.990   01:25:08.330  
isn't   working out then you can tweak it
or     major  

01:25:08.330   01:25:08.340  
or   sometimes you have to make a major
  

01:25:08.340   01:25:10.220

the plan to get better as   you implement
  

01:25:37.290   01:25:39.320  
the plan to get better as   you implement 
   reasonable  

01:25:39.320   01:25:39.330  
  it so you just start with AB reasonable
  

01:25:39.330   01:25:40.880  
  it so you just start with AB reasonable
plan     about  

01:25:40.880   01:25:40.890  
plan so   you don't have to worry about
  

01:25:40.890   01:25:43.730  
plan so   you don't have to worry about 
   correct  

01:25:43.730   01:25:43.740  
  whether it's correct it's not correct
  

01:25:43.740   01:25:45.950  
  whether it's correct it's not correct
doesn't     nothing  

01:25:45.950   01:25:45.960  
  doesn't matter it's better than nothing
  

01:25:45.960   01:25:47.690  
  doesn't matter it's better than nothing
that's     got  

01:25:47.690   01:25:47.700  
that's the issue so   okay so you've got
  

01:25:47.700   01:25:50.720  
that's the issue so   okay so you've got 
   that  

01:25:50.720   01:25:50.730  
   into things that
  

01:25:50.730   01:25:53.000  
   into things that 
   at  

01:25:53.000   01:25:53.010  
   look at
  

01:25:53.010   01:25:55.880  
   look at
them     that  

01:25:55.880   01:25:55.890  
them things that get in the way   that
  

01:25:55.890   01:25:57.530  
them things that get in the way   that
produce     negative     a  

01:25:57.530   01:25:57.540  
produce negative   emotion and then a
  

01:25:57.540   01:25:59.600  
produce negative   emotion and then a
whole     because  

01:25:59.600   01:25:59.610  
whole host of irrelevant things because
 

01:25:59.610   01:26:01.640  
whole host of irrelevant things because
almost     everything    and  

01:26:01.640   01:26:01.650  
almost everything   and
  

01:26:01.650   01:26:04.520  
almost everything   and
that's     all     the  

01:26:04.520   01:26:04.530  
that's where all   the chaos is hiding the
  

01:26:04.530   01:26:07.120  
that's where all   the chaos is hiding the
chaos     irrelevant  

01:26:07.120   01:26:07.130  
chaos is hiding in what's irrelevant
 

01:26:07.130   01:26:09.459  
chaos is hiding in what's irrelevant
and     and    interesting  

01:26:09.459   01:26:09.469  
and so and   that's very interesting
  

01:26:09.469   01:26:11.379  
and so and   that's very interesting
observation     is  

01:26:11.379   01:26:11.389  
  observation because since the chaos is
  

01:26:11.389   01:26:12.970  
  observation because since the chaos is
virtually    surreal  

01:26:12.970   01:26:12.980  
virtually   I think surreal
  

01:26:12.980   01:26:14.530  
virtually   I think surreal 
   it  

01:26:14.530   01:26:14.540  
   hell do you put it
  

01:26:14.540   01:26:16.780  
   hell do you put it 
   and  

01:26:16.780   01:26:16.790  
   in what you ignore and
  

01:26:16.790   01:26:18.610  
   in what you ignore and
you     can     isn't  

01:26:18.610   01:26:18.620  
you can   it as long as it isn't
  

01:26:18.620   01:26:20.620  
you can   it as long as it isn't
actively     with     movement  

01:26:20.620   01:26:20.630  
actively interfering with   your movement
  

01:26:20.630   01:26:23.590  
actively interfering with   your movement
forward     it  

01:26:23.590   01:26:23.600  
forward   you can assume that it's that it
  

01:26:23.600   01:26:26.260  
forward   you can assume that it's that it 
   it  

01:26:26.260   01:26:26.270  
   it in matter that it
  

01:26:26.270   01:26:30.640  
   it in matter that it
doesn't     matter     so  

01:26:30.640   01:26:30.650  
doesn't matter   same thing alright so
  

01:26:30.650   01:26:32.950  
doesn't matter   same thing alright so
here's     the     class  

01:26:32.950   01:26:32.960  
here's the   kicker there's one more class
  

01:26:32.960   01:26:35.709  
here's the   kicker there's one more class
of     into     along  

01:26:35.709   01:26:35.719  
of things   along
  

01:26:35.719   01:26:37.810  
of things   along
the     chaos  

01:26:37.810   01:26:37.820  
the way and this   is where the chaos
  

01:26:37.820   01:26:46.300  
the way and this   is where the chaos
breaks     you're  

01:26:46.300   01:26:46.310  
breaks through so let's say you're
 

01:26:46.310   01:26:48.660  
breaks through so let's say you're
   and  

01:26:48.660   01:26:48.670  
   A to point B and
  

01:26:48.670   01:26:51.250  
   A to point B and
something     expect  

01:26:51.250   01:26:51.260  
something   that you don't expect
  

01:26:51.260   01:26:54.520  
something   that you don't expect 
   so  

01:26:54.520   01:26:54.530  
   so
  

01:26:54.530   01:26:58.060  
   so
let's     that     with  

01:26:58.060   01:26:58.070  
let's   you're living with
  

01:26:58.070   01:26:59.470  
let's   you're living with
someone     kind     them  

01:26:59.470   01:26:59.480  
someone   of like them
  

01:26:59.480   01:27:01.360  
someone   of like them
you're    like  

01:27:01.360   01:27:01.370  
you're   not married so you don't like
  

01:27:01.370   01:27:02.800  
you're   not married so you don't like
them    you'd  

01:27:02.800   01:27:02.810  
them   you'd
  

01:27:02.810   01:27:07.419  
them   you'd
ask     and     so  

01:27:07.419   01:27:07.429  
ask them to marry   so
  

01:27:07.429   01:27:09.520  
ask them to marry   so

emotionally to that well the part of you
   the  

01:27:28.780   01:27:28.790  
  that wasn't all that committed to the

relationship   is kind of exhilarated by
that     half  

01:27:32.979   01:27:32.989  
that and then the   3/4 of you that's half
  

01:27:32.989   01:27:35.200  
that and then the   3/4 of you that's half
satisfied     going  

01:27:35.200   01:27:35.210  
satisfied is hurt and and you're going

01:27:36.980   01:27:39.070  
to exploit   in the
ensuing     the  

01:27:39.070   01:27:39.080  
ensuing discussions and not   mention the
  

01:27:39.080   01:27:41.050  
ensuing discussions and not   mention the 
   you  

01:27:41.050   01:27:41.060  
  oh that's kind of exciting that you you
  

01:27:41.060   01:27:45.970  
  oh that's kind of exciting that you you
know     the  

01:27:45.970   01:27:45.980  
know betrayed me that way so so but the
 

01:27:45.980   01:27:48.580  
know betrayed me that way so so but the
point     that    now  

01:27:48.580   01:27:48.590  
point is is that   you that's a whole now
  

01:27:48.590   01:27:51.189  
point is is that   you that's a whole now
what's     have  

01:27:51.189   01:27:51.199  
what's happened as a whole has you have
 

01:27:51.199   01:27:53.260  
what's happened as a whole has you have
   on  

01:27:53.260   01:27:53.270  
   that you're walking on
  

01:27:53.270   01:27:55.120  
   that you're walking on 
   you're  

01:27:55.120   01:27:55.130  
  like ice like the thin ice that you're
  

01:27:55.130   01:27:57.070  
  like ice like the thin ice that you're
skating     it  

01:27:57.070   01:27:57.080  
skating on   and now there's a hole in it
  

01:27:57.080   01:27:59.860  
skating on   and now there's a hole in it 
   deep  

01:27:59.860   01:27:59.870  
  and the hole we don't even know how deep
  

01:27:59.870   01:28:01.270  
  and the hole we don't even know how deep
the    hole  

01:28:01.270   01:28:01.280  
the   hole is but you know there's a hole
  

01:28:01.280   01:28:03.310  
the   hole is but you know there's a hole
there     it  

01:28:03.310   01:28:03.320  
there   and so now you're anxious about it
  

01:28:03.320   01:28:05.050  
there   and so now you're anxious about it
though     little     excited  

01:28:05.050   01:28:05.060  
though maybe   excited
  

01:28:05.060   01:28:06.729  
though maybe   excited
because    there  

01:28:06.729   01:28:06.739  
because   down there
  

01:28:06.739   01:28:10.030  
because   down there
but     with  

01:28:10.030   01:28:10.040  
but but you don't   know what to do with
  

01:28:10.040   01:28:11.979  
but but you don't   know what to do with 
   very  

01:28:11.979   01:28:11.989  
   because it could spread very
  

01:28:11.989   01:28:14.500  
   because it could spread very 
   know  

01:28:14.500   01:28:14.510  
   it could be that you know
  

01:28:14.510   01:28:17.129  
   it could be that you know 
   and  

01:28:17.129   01:28:17.139  
  the whole relationship was a facade and
  

01:28:17.139   01:28:19.360  
  the whole relationship was a facade and
that     relationships     been  

01:28:19.360   01:28:19.370  
that all your relationships   have been

facade facade
and     the    because  

01:28:22.060   01:28:22.070  
and that the   is is because
  

01:28:22.070   01:28:23.560  
and that the   is is because

01:28:23.570   01:28:24.580  
  you're so damn shallow that it's 
   a  

01:28:24.580   01:28:24.590  
   you to have a
  

01:28:24.590   01:28:26.650  
   you to have a

01:28:26.650   01:28:26.660  
  relationship that isn't just a facade
  

01:28:26.660   01:28:28.720  
  relationship that isn't just a facade
and     pay  

01:28:28.720   01:28:28.730  
and that's partly because   you don't pay
  

01:28:28.730   01:28:29.979  
and that's partly because   you don't pay
any    it's  

01:28:29.979   01:28:29.989  
any   it's
  

01:28:29.989   01:28:31.540  
any   it's
also     because     and  

01:28:31.540   01:28:31.550  
also partly because   your malevolent and
  

01:28:31.550   01:28:33.610  
also partly because   your malevolent and
selfish    to  

01:28:33.610   01:28:33.620  
selfish   to
  

01:28:33.620   01:28:35.620  
selfish   to 
   of

  discover or maybe that's the sort of
  

01:28:35.630   01:28:37.510  
  discover or maybe that's the sort of
person     which  

01:28:37.510   01:28:37.520  
  person that you're attracting which
  

01:28:37.520   01:28:39.160  
  person that you're attracting which
would     sense     the

what's     it    well  

01:33:57.540   01:33:57.550  
what's that anomaly made out it   well
  

01:33:57.550   01:33:58.859  
what's that anomaly made out it   well
here's     way     made  

01:33:58.859   01:33:58.869  
here's a   of thinking but it's made
  

01:33:58.869   01:34:01.700  
here's a   of thinking but it's made
out     matter     why

Piaget said   made out of matter
  

01:34:07.480   01:34:09.600  
Piaget said   made out of matter
because     world  

01:34:09.600   01:34:09.610  
because   of course that's the world
  

01:34:09.610   01:34:11.490  
because   of course that's the world
matter     what

rabbit   hole when you go into the
  

01:34:21.070   01:34:22.470  
rabbit   hole when you go into the
underworld    everything  

01:34:22.470   01:34:22.480  
underworld   that's underneath everything
  

01:34:22.480   01:34:25.229  
underworld   that's underneath everything
that     things  

01:34:25.229   01:34:25.239  
  that you've relied on you learn things
  

01:34:25.239   01:34:26.729  
  that you've relied on you learn things 
   is  

01:34:26.729   01:34:26.739  
  down there so what's down there is
  

01:34:26.739   01:34:29.370  
  down there so what's down there is
information    maybe  

01:34:29.370   01:34:29.380  
information   that's now it's maybe
  

01:34:29.380   01:34:31.470  
information   that's now it's maybe
way     but  

01:34:31.470   01:34:31.480  
way more information   than you want but
  

01:34:31.480   01:34:34.350  
way more information   than you want but
it     is     and  

01:34:34.350   01:34:34.360  
it is   it's information and
  

01:34:34.360   01:34:35.939  
it is   it's information and
what     the  

01:34:35.939   01:34:35.949  
what can what can   you do with the

what can what can   you do with the 
   with  

01:34:38.790   01:34:38.800  
   can inform yourself with

   can inform yourself with
the    put  

01:34:40.890   01:34:40.900  
the   right you could put
  

01:34:40.900   01:34:43.500  
the   right you could put
yourself     with     the  

01:34:43.500   01:34:43.510  
yourself   the
  

01:34:43.510   01:34:46.830  
yourself   the
information     so  

01:34:46.830   01:34:46.840  
information that's helpful   too and so
  

01:34:46.840   01:34:49.109  
information that's helpful   too and so
and     psyche  

01:34:49.109   01:34:49.119  
and   you think well you you're a psyche
  

01:34:49.119   01:34:51.450  
and   you think well you you're a psyche 
   you  

01:34:51.450   01:34:51.460  
   on you
  

01:34:51.460   01:34:52.950  
   on you
know     not  

01:34:52.950   01:34:52.960  
know whether you're a materialist or not
 

01:34:52.960   01:34:54.359  
know whether you're a materialist or not
but     at    a  

01:34:54.359   01:34:54.369  
but at   least we can say that you're a
  

01:34:54.369   01:34:55.919  
but at   least we can say that you're a
psyche     your  

01:34:55.919   01:34:55.929  
psyche the question is what's your
 

01:34:55.929   01:34:58.109  
psyche the question is what's your
psyche     obviously    go  

01:34:58.109   01:34:58.119  
psyche made up well it's obviously   go
  

01:34:58.119   01:34:59.020  
psyche made up well it's obviously   go
out     some  

01:34:59.020   01:34:59.030  
  out of material some
  

01:34:59.030   01:35:01.390  
  out of material some 
   be  

01:35:01.390   01:35:01.400  
  right but the matter happens to be
  

01:35:01.400   01:35:04.149  
  right but the matter happens to be 
   that's  

01:35:04.149   01:35:04.159  
  arrayed in a particular order and that's
  

01:35:04.159   01:35:07.029  
  arrayed in a particular order and that's
an     you  

01:35:07.029   01:35:07.039  
an information order and so when you
 

01:35:07.039   01:35:08.439  
an information order and so when you
fall     that's 

01:35:08.439   01:35:08.449  
fall into the underworld that's
 

01:35:08.449   01:35:09.790  
fall into the underworld that's
underneath     everything    encounter  

01:35:09.790   01:35:09.800  
underneath everything   and you encounter
  

01:35:09.800   01:35:12.040  
underneath everything   and you encounter 
   you  

01:35:12.040   01:35:12.050  
  that latent information then what you
  

01:35:12.050   01:35:14.049  
  that latent information then what you
can     enhance     can  

01:35:14.049   01:35:14.059  
can do is enhance   your psyche you can
  

01:35:14.059   01:35:15.760  
can do is enhance   your psyche you can
grow     is  

01:35:15.760   01:35:15.770  
grow your spirit because what you do is
 

01:35:15.770   01:35:18.510  
grow your spirit because what you do is
   you  

01:35:18.510   01:35:18.520  
  you take the new information and you
  

01:35:18.520   01:35:20.799  
  you take the new information and you 
   the  

01:35:20.799   01:35:20.809  
  incorporate it that's like eating the
  

01:35:20.809   01:35:22.540  
  incorporate it that's like eating the
Apple     that     you  

01:35:22.540   01:35:22.550  
Apple that   out of an EVE it you
  

01:35:22.550   01:35:24.490

metaphysical proposition it's not to say
 

01:35:29.090   01:35:30.609  
metaphysical proposition it's not to say
nothing   what  

01:35:30.609   01:35:30.619  
nothing   other than well that's what
  

01:35:30.619   01:35:32.319  
nothing   other than well that's what
happens     think  

01:35:32.319   01:35:32.329  
happens when   children learn you think
  

01:35:32.329   01:35:34.569  
happens when   children learn you think
what     a  

01:35:34.569   01:35:34.579  
what happens   charles's three has a
  

01:35:34.579   01:35:37.390  
what happens   charles's three has a
pretty     resolution     of  

01:35:37.390   01:35:37.400  
pretty low resolution   representation of
  

01:35:37.400   01:35:40.140  
pretty low resolution   representation of
the     resolution  

01:35:40.140   01:35:40.150  
the world and is a fairly   low resolution
  

01:35:40.150   01:35:42.850  
the world and is a fairly   low resolution
human     constituent  

01:35:42.850   01:35:42.860  
human being got all the constituent
 

01:35:42.860   01:35:44.770  
human being got all the constituent
elements     differentiated 

01:35:44.770   01:35:44.780

in     all

in any tremendous manner that's all

in any tremendous manner that's all
still     future    what  

01:35:48.760   01:35:48.770  
still to come in the future   and so what
  

01:35:48.770   01:35:51.279  
still to come in the future   and so what
if     do     they  

01:35:51.279   01:35:51.289  
if the child do   explore what do they
  

01:35:51.289   01:35:53.680  
if the child do   explore what do they
explore     understand  

01:35:53.680   01:35:53.690  
explore things they don't understand
 

01:35:53.690   01:35:55.419  
explore things they don't understand
that's     where    because  

01:35:55.419   01:35:55.429  
that's where   the information is because
  

01:35:55.429   01:35:57.129  
that's where   the information is because
you     you  

01:35:57.129   01:35:57.139  
you already understand what you
 

01:35:57.139   01:35:58.569  
you already understand what you
understand     no    there  

01:35:58.569   01:35:58.579  
understand there's no   information there
  

01:35:58.579   01:36:00.370  
understand there's no   information there 
   don't  

01:36:00.370   01:36:00.380  
   you don't
  

01:36:00.380   01:36:01.839  
   you don't 
   information  

01:36:01.839   01:36:01.849  
  understand that's where the information
  

01:36:01.849   01:36:03.850  
  understand that's where the information
is     you  

01:36:03.850   01:36:03.860  
  is and out of that information you
  

01:36:03.860   01:36:06.129  
  is and out of that information you
generate     and  

01:36:06.129   01:36:06.139  
generate a   higher resolution world and
  

01:36:06.139   01:36:08.260  
generate a   higher resolution world and
you     self  

01:36:08.260   01:36:08.270  
you generate a higher resolution self
 

01:36:08.270   01:36:11.200  
you generate a higher resolution self
   the  

01:36:11.200   01:36:11.210  
   the combat with the
  

01:36:11.210   01:36:13.600  
   the combat with the
underlying     generate  

01:36:13.600   01:36:13.610  
underlying dragon of chaos you   generate
  

01:36:13.610   01:36:15.850  
underlying dragon of chaos you   generate
spirit     do  

01:36:15.850   01:36:15.860  
spirit and matter   and that's what you do
  

01:36:15.860   01:36:18.250  
spirit and matter   and that's what you do
when     so  

01:36:18.250   01:36:18.260  
when   you go down into the underworld so
  

01:36:18.260   01:36:21.069  
when   you go down into the underworld so
if     kill     doesn't  

01:36:21.069   01:36:21.079  
if it doesn't   or if it doesn't
  

01:36:21.079   01:36:22.330  
if it doesn't   or if it doesn't
make     you  

01:36:22.330   01:36:22.340  
make you wish you   were dead which you
  

01:36:22.340   01:36:24.399  
make you wish you   were dead which you
probably     you  

01:36:24.399   01:36:24.409  
probably   will but there's a bunch of you
  

01:36:24.409   01:36:25.990  
probably   will but there's a bunch of you
that     die     so  

01:36:25.990   01:36:26.000  
that has to   down there anyway so
  

01:36:26.000   01:36:27.279  
that has to   down there anyway so 
   thing  

01:36:27.279   01:36:27.289  
  maybe that's not such a bad thing
  

01:36:27.289   01:36:29.500  
  maybe that's not such a bad thing 
   relationship  

01:36:29.500   01:36:29.510  
  because if you had this relationship
  

01:36:29.510   01:36:31.359  
  because if you had this relationship
that    there's  

01:36:31.359   01:36:31.369  
that   ended in betrayal then there's
  

01:36:31.369   01:36:33.010  
that   ended in betrayal then there's
something    right  

01:36:33.010   01:36:33.020  
something   right
  

01:36:33.020   01:36:35.350  
something   right
right     wentz     and  

01:36:35.350   01:36:35.360  
right there's something   and
  

01:36:35.360   01:36:36.970  
right there's something   and
the     that     well  

01:36:36.970   01:36:36.980  
the reason I'm saying that   think well
  

01:36:36.980   01:36:38.890  
the reason I'm saying that   think well 
   like  

01:36:38.890   01:36:38.900  
  that's kind of moralistic it's like
  

01:36:38.900   01:36:40.510  
  that's kind of moralistic it's like
actually     don't     moralistic  

01:36:40.510   01:36:40.520  
actually I don't   moralistic
  

01:36:40.520   01:36:43.390  
actually I don't   moralistic
in     but  

01:36:43.390   01:36:43.400  
in case you haven't noticed   but but
  

01:36:43.400   01:36:45.040  
in case you haven't noticed   but but
that's     comment  

01:36:45.040   01:36:45.050  
that's not it's not   a fair comment
  

01:36:45.050   01:36:46.629  
that's not it's not   a fair comment
because     playing     game  

01:36:46.629   01:36:46.639  
because   this stupid game
  

01:36:46.639   01:36:49.810  
because   this stupid game 
   in  

01:36:49.810   01:36:49.820  
   in
  

01:36:49.820   01:36:52.930  
   in
fidelity     game     you've  

01:36:52.930   01:36:52.940  
   right you've
  

01:36:52.940   01:36:55.209  
   right you've
decided     a  

01:36:55.209   01:36:55.219  
decided the rules   with the game comes a
  

01:36:55.219   01:36:57.430  
decided the rules   with the game comes a
morality    of  

01:36:57.430   01:36:57.440  
morality   morality are the rules of
  

01:36:57.440   01:37:00.010  
morality   morality are the rules of
the     collapses  

01:37:00.010   01:37:00.020  
the game   well then the thing collapses
  

01:37:00.020   01:37:02.709  
the game   well then the thing collapses
into     infidelity     you  

01:37:02.709   01:37:02.719  
into infidelity   you
  

01:37:02.719   01:37:04.120  
into infidelity   you
played     the  

01:37:04.120   01:37:04.130  
played the   game wrong or it was the
  

01:37:04.130   01:37:06.160  
played the   game wrong or it was the
wrong     one     one  

01:37:06.160   01:37:06.170  
wrong game one   you it's one
  

01:37:06.170   01:37:09.580  
wrong game one   you it's one
of     and  

01:37:09.580   01:37:09.590  
of those two you pick the damn game and
 

01:37:09.590   01:37:11.720  
of those two you pick the damn game and
having     can't 

01:37:11.720   01:37:11.730  
having picked the game you can't
 

01:37:11.730   01:37:13.550  
having picked the game you can't
say     those    it's  

01:37:13.550   01:37:13.560  
say well no those   aren't the rules it's
  

01:37:13.560   01:37:16.400  
say well no those   aren't the rules it's

comes     there  

01:40:38.180   01:40:38.190  
comes up and then maybe you go   out there

that's     hopefully

that's human existence   and hopefully
  

01:41:04.770   01:41:08.590  
that's human existence   and hopefully
it's     it's

it's not just a little linear it's   it's

actually     might

describe   as measurable progress right
  

01:41:25.650   01:41:27.020  
describe   as measurable progress right
and     against  

01:41:27.020   01:41:27.030  
  and that's another argument against
  

01:41:27.030   01:41:30.620  
  and that's another argument against 
   do  

01:41:30.620   01:41:30.630  
   because if you can do
  

01:41:30.630   01:41:32.150  
   because if you can do
everything     could     and  

01:41:32.150   01:41:32.160  
everything that   before and
  

01:41:32.160   01:41:33.980  
everything that   before and
you     could  

01:41:33.980   01:41:33.990  
you can do some more things we could
 

01:41:33.990   01:41:36.080  
you can do some more things we could
just   a  

01:41:36.080   01:41:36.090  
just   a
  

01:41:36.090   01:41:37.790  
just   a

01:41:37.800   01:41:39.320  
bad definition and then we have
up     you're    is  

01:41:39.320   01:41:39.330  
up it's like what you're   trying to do is
  

01:41:39.330   01:41:43.900  
up it's like what you're   trying to do is
to     and  

01:41:43.900   01:41:43.910  
to   differentiate the world and
  

01:41:43.910   01:41:46.400  
to   differentiate the world and
differentiate     time  

01:41:46.400   01:41:46.410  
differentiate yourself   and every time
  

01:41:46.410   01:41:47.810  
differentiate yourself   and every time
you     revolutions  

01:41:47.810   01:41:47.820  
you undergo one of these revolutions
 

01:41:47.820   01:41:49.670  
you undergo one of these revolutions
   things  

01:41:49.670   01:41:49.680  
  then hopefully both of those things
  

01:41:49.680   01:41:51.770  
  then hopefully both of those things
happen     to     that  

01:41:51.770   01:41:51.780  
   that
  

01:41:51.780   01:41:55.040  
   that

01:41:55.040   01:41:55.050  
story   which is do it voluntarily
  

01:41:55.050   01:41:59.540  
story   which is do it voluntarily 
   to  

01:41:59.540   01:41:59.550  
   wait for it to

01:42:02.580   01:42:04.790  
happen catastrophic   keep your eyes 
   little  

01:42:04.790   01:42:04.800  
   and when something goes a little
  

01:42:04.800   01:42:07.940  
   and when something goes a little 
   it  

01:42:07.940   01:42:07.950  
  bit wrong that you could fix fix it
  

01:42:07.950   01:42:11.720  
  bit wrong that you could fix fix it 
   maybe  

01:42:11.720   01:42:11.730  
  don't say no that doesn't matter maybe
  

01:42:11.730   01:42:14.030  
  don't say no that doesn't matter maybe

   get out of
the     matter  

01:42:34.940   01:42:34.950  
the kick a kick out of   the word matter
  

01:42:34.950   01:42:36.230  
the kick a kick out of   the word matter
because     weird  

01:42:36.230   01:42:36.240  
because it's got these   two weird
  

01:42:36.240   01:42:38.090  
because it's got these   two weird
meanings     that  

01:42:38.090   01:42:38.100  
meanings right there's the matter that
 

01:42:38.100   01:42:40.070  
meanings right there's the matter that
everything     made    the  

01:42:40.070   01:42:40.080  
everything is made   the
  

01:42:40.080   01:42:41.930  
everything is made   the
materialists     made  

01:42:41.930   01:42:41.940

   and
  

01:42:43.530   01:42:45.260  
   and
then     is  

01:42:45.260   01:42:45.270  
then there's the   matter that life is
  

01:42:45.270   01:42:47.780  
then there's the   matter that life is
made     out     and  

01:42:47.780   01:42:47.790  
made out   and
  

01:42:47.790   01:42:49.520  
made out   and
now     you're     life  

01:42:49.520   01:42:49.530  
now and then   life
  

01:42:49.530   01:42:51.440  
now and then   life
and    to  

01:42:51.440   01:42:51.450  
and   it's calling to
  

01:42:51.450   01:42:53.660  
and   it's calling to 
   world  

01:42:53.660   01:42:53.670  
   and that's the unrevealed world
  

01:42:53.670   01:42:56.030  
   and that's the unrevealed world
trying     to     all  

01:42:56.030   01:42:56.040  
trying to   all
  

01:42:56.040   01:42:58.490  
trying to   all
you     reveal  

01:42:58.490   01:42:58.500  
  you have to do is allow it to reveal
  

01:42:58.500   01:43:00.470  
  you have to do is allow it to reveal
itself     you     what  

01:43:00.470   01:43:00.480  
itself to   maybe what
  

01:43:00.480   01:43:03.920  
itself to   maybe what
happens     is     shifted  

01:43:03.920   01:43:03.930  
happens is   that a minor shifted
  

01:43:03.930   01:43:05.780  
happens is   that a minor shifted
shape     to     you  

01:43:05.780   01:43:05.790  
shape is all that has to   happen to you
  

01:43:05.790   01:43:07.700  
shape is all that has to   happen to you
you     have     the  

01:43:07.700   01:43:07.710  
you   to burn right down to the
  

01:43:07.710   01:43:10.550  
you   to burn right down to the

something happens it matters   so what are
you     with     you're

supposed to you're   supposed to fix it 
   that's  

01:43:38.360   01:43:38.370  
   with it that's
  

01:43:38.370   01:43:40.310  
   with it that's
why     it  

01:43:40.310   01:43:40.320  
why it's calling out   to you as if it
  

01:43:40.320   01:43:42.400  
why it's calling out   to you as if it
matters     an  

01:43:42.400   01:43:42.410  
matters it's saying there's an

01:43:44.420   01:43:44.430  
indeterminate part of the world here
 

01:43:44.430   01:43:46.760

that wants   to manifest itself into fully
articulated     to  

01:43:49.340   01:43:49.350  
articulated being and it's   calling to
  

01:43:49.350   01:43:50.660  
articulated being and it's   calling to
you     that  

01:43:50.660   01:43:50.670  
you   to do that
  

01:43:50.670   01:43:53.060  
you   to do that
and     ignore     accumulates  

01:43:53.060   01:43:53.070  
and if you ignore   it then it accumulates
  

01:43:53.070   01:43:55.400  
and if you ignore   it then it accumulates 
   the

one   a--
pointed     that     to

pointed out was that   what happens to

pointed out was that   what happens to 
   cultures  

01:45:53.930   01:45:53.940  
  human memory in preliterate cultures
  

01:45:53.940   01:45:55.570  
  human memory in preliterate cultures
because     that  

01:45:55.570   01:45:55.580  
because nothing is   written down is that
  

01:45:55.580   01:45:58.250  
because nothing is   written down is that
what    gets

thing you can   possibly imagine about 
   it's  

01:46:15.229   01:46:15.239  
  fish because otherwise they die so it's
  

01:46:15.239   01:46:16.370  
  fish because otherwise they die so it's
really     important     learn

really important   learn
  

01:46:16.380   01:46:18.050  
really important   learn
everything     they've  

01:46:18.050   01:46:18.060  
everything about   fish and maybe they've

   and so then the
  

01:46:23.880   01:46:27.170  
   and so then the 
   how  

01:46:27.170   01:46:27.180  
  question is well who taught mankind how

whatever's gone wrong and that would
require   your

require   some retooling on both of your

require   some retooling on both of your

  I've noticed that this has been

happening and maybe   it's you and maybe
it's     it

it's me and we should probably figure   it
  

01:52:40.150   01:52:41.820  
it's me and we should probably figure   it
out     be

  out because if it was you that be
  

01:52:41.830   01:52:43.440  
  out because if it was you that be 
   was  

01:52:43.440   01:52:43.450

  convenient and everything but if it was
me    then  

01:52:46.080   01:52:46.090  
me   then I'd like to fix it because then
  

01:52:46.090   01:52:47.610  
me   then I'd like to fix it because then
it     you  

01:52:47.610   01:52:47.620  
it   would be fixed and so that's why you
  

01:52:47.620   01:52:49.050  
it   would be fixed and so that's why you
listen     they  

01:52:49.050   01:52:49.060  
listen to your partner   because they
  

01:52:49.060   01:52:50.130  
listen to your partner   because they
might     you     something

might   that there's something

  stupid about you that you don't know and

  stupid about you that you don't know and
then     you  

01:52:53.640   01:52:53.650  
then if you could fix that then you
 

01:52:53.650   01:52:54.930  
then if you could fix that then you
wouldn't   way

judeo-christian tradition   but I think
there     be     that

there might be   a bit of an error in that

there might be   a bit of an error in that

catastrophe     idea  

01:53:48.640   01:53:48.650  
catastrophe   and so here's the flood idea
  

01:53:48.650   01:53:50.560  
catastrophe   and so here's the flood idea
you     think     so  

01:53:50.560   01:53:50.570  
you tell me what you think   so
  

01:53:50.570   01:53:52.390  
you tell me what you think   so
you     that     a  

01:53:52.390   01:53:52.400  
you know so there's this idea   a
  

01:53:52.400   01:53:55.000  
you know so there's this idea   a
judgmental     if  

01:53:55.000   01:53:55.010  
judgmental being will flood you out if
 

01:53:55.010   01:53:57.430  
judgmental being will flood you out if
you     on    and  

01:53:57.430   01:53:57.440  
you continue on   and
  

01:53:57.440   01:53:59.440  
you continue on   and
that     you     know  

01:53:59.440   01:53:59.450  
that seems   know
  

01:53:59.450   01:54:02.110  
that seems   know
it's     being

it's one of   the examples of Jehova being

it's one of   the examples of Jehova being

   not something that modern

  we like our God sort of domesticated 
   unfortunately  

01:54:14.590   01:54:14.600  
   that way and unfortunately
  

01:54:14.600   01:54:16.300  
   that way and unfortunately 
   I've  

01:54:16.300   01:54:16.310  
   work but I've
  

01:54:16.310   01:54:19.030  
   work but I've
often     in  

01:54:19.030   01:54:19.040  
often thought   about the reaction in
  

01:54:19.040   01:54:25.170  
often thought   about the reaction in
North     in  

01:54:25.170   01:54:25.180  
North America to the   hurricane end in
  

01:54:25.180   01:54:28.390  
North America to the   hurricane end in
New     Orleans     of  

01:54:28.390   01:54:28.400  
New Orleans   because there's two ways of
  

01:54:28.400   01:54:31.350  
New Orleans   because there's two ways of
reading     Nature  

01:54:31.350   01:54:31.360  
reading   that right one is Mother Nature

01:54:51.700   01:54:51.710

it's     dikes  

01:54:55.510   01:54:55.520  
it's like you know the Dutch build dikes
 

01:54:55.520   01:54:57.760  
it's like you know the Dutch build dikes
right     the    they're  

01:54:57.760   01:54:57.770  
right to keep the   and they're

   that
  

01:54:59.360   01:55:00.520  
   that
because     mostly  

01:55:00.520   01:55:00.530

   that if you
go     not

working and   so the Dutch were very

come     years     that  

01:55:28.210   01:55:28.220  
come in 10,000 years   and make sure that

come in 10,000 years   and make sure that
the     will     that

the   withstand that
well     of

well from   my reading the Army Corps of

well from   my reading the Army Corps of

01:55:37.129   01:55:37.139  
  Engineers in New Orleans built the dykes
  

01:55:37.139   01:55:39.250  
  Engineers in New Orleans built the dykes
for     years     and

for a storm every hundred years   and
  

01:55:39.260   01:55:42.850  
for a storm every hundred years   and
that's     about  

01:55:42.850   01:55:42.860  
that's   not so good because we live about
  

01:55:42.860   01:55:45.500  
that's   not so good because we live about
8    say     the

going to come   lifespan 
   that

   if that's the rule
  

01:58:05.640   01:58:07.490  
   if that's the rule 
   priori  

01:58:07.490   01:58:07.500  
   that's it's like the a priori

   that's it's like the a priori 
   hey

you   didn't take every advantage of every 
   to  

02:00:29.259   02:00:29.269  
   possibly could have to
  

02:00:29.269   02:00:31.899  
   possibly could have to 
   it  

02:00:31.899   02:00:31.909  
  take some spare chaos and transform it
  

02:00:31.909   02:00:34.089  
  take some spare chaos and transform it
into    a  

02:00:34.089   02:00:34.099  
into   a bit of habitable order that's a
  

02:00:34.099   02:00:35.229  
into   a bit of habitable order that's a
good     think     that's  

02:00:35.229   02:00:35.239  
good thing to think   well that's
  

02:00:35.239   02:00:36.669  
good thing to think   well that's 
   make  

02:00:36.669   02:00:36.679  
  what you're thinking about when you make
  

02:00:36.679   02:00:38.049  
  what you're thinking about when you make
a     new     you  

02:00:38.049   02:00:38.059  
a new   year's resolution even though you
  

02:00:38.059   02:00:39.819  
a new   year's resolution even though you 
   you  

02:00:39.819   02:00:39.829  
   like well could you
  

02:00:39.829   02:00:42.850  
   like well could you 
   year  

02:00:42.850   02:00:42.860  
   the upcoming year
  

02:00:42.860   02:00:53.109  
   the upcoming year 
   then  

02:00:53.109   02:00:53.119  
  well you can imagine the flood and then
  

02:00:53.119   02:00:56.350  
  well you can imagine the flood and then
you     set     then  

02:00:56.350   02:00:56.360  
you can set   and then
  

02:00:56.360   02:00:58.120  
you can set   and then 
   means  

02:00:58.120   02:00:58.130  
   means
  

02:00:58.130   02:01:00.430  
   means
maybe     also  

02:01:00.430   02:01:00.440  
maybe   you can stave it off but it also
  

02:01:00.440   02:01:02.500  
maybe   you can stave it off but it also 
   stave  

02:01:02.500   02:01:02.510  
   if you don't stave
  

02:01:02.510   02:01:05.410  
   if you don't stave
it     could     that's  

02:01:05.410   02:01:05.420  
it off you could   write it out and that's
  

02:01:05.420   02:01:07.870  
it off you could   write it out and that's 
   what  

02:01:07.870   02:01:07.880  
  actually the story of Noah because what
  

02:01:07.880   02:01:10.209  
  actually the story of Noah because what
happens    see  

02:01:10.209   02:01:10.219  
happens   with Noah is that he can see
  

02:01:10.219   02:01:13.509  
happens   with Noah is that he can see 
   that  

02:01:13.509   02:01:13.519  
   that
  

02:01:13.519   02:01:16.779  
   that
there's     coming     maybe  

02:01:16.779   02:01:16.789  
there's a flood coming   and God is maybe
  

02:01:16.789   02:01:18.939  
there's a flood coming   and God is maybe 
   the  

02:01:18.939   02:01:18.949  
   the
  

02:01:18.949   02:01:20.859  
   the
story     remember  

02:01:20.859   02:01:20.869  
  story that Noah walked with God remember
  

02:01:20.869   02:01:22.239  
  story that Noah walked with God remember
and     got  

02:01:22.239   02:01:22.249  
and   that's what Adam did before he got
  

02:01:22.249   02:01:23.859  
and   that's what Adam did before he got
all     thing  

02:01:23.859   02:01:23.869  
all   self-conscious about the whole thing
  

02:01:23.869   02:01:25.689  
all   self-conscious about the whole thing
he     God     that  

02:01:25.689   02:01:25.699  
he walked with   that
  

02:01:25.699   02:01:27.310  
he walked with   that 
   mean  

02:01:27.310   02:01:27.320  
   next time but what that would mean
  

02:01:27.320   02:01:30.850  
   next time but what that would mean
maybe     because     and  

02:01:30.850   02:01:30.860  
maybe is because   Noah was straight and
  

02:01:30.860   02:01:33.250  
maybe is because   Noah was straight and
he     himself     familial  

02:01:33.250   02:01:33.260  
he put himself   and his familial
  

02:01:33.260   02:01:34.839  
he put himself   and his familial
relationships     good     also  

02:01:34.839   02:01:34.849  
relationships were good   because it also
  

02:01:34.849   02:01:37.359  
relationships were good   because it also
says     working  

02:01:37.359   02:01:37.369  
says that that his   antennae were working
  

02:01:37.369   02:01:39.970  
says that that his   antennae were working
and     into  

02:01:39.970   02:01:39.980  
and he could see a   little farther into
  

02:01:39.980   02:01:41.859  
and he could see a   little farther into
the     was  

02:01:41.859   02:01:41.869  
the future than   someone whose vision was
  

02:01:41.869   02:01:44.799  
the future than   someone whose vision was
completely     chaos  

02:01:44.799   02:01:44.809  
completely obscured by by fog and chaos
 

02:01:44.809   02:01:48.549  
completely obscured by by fog and chaos
and     tell    not  

02:01:48.549   02:01:48.559  
and he could tell   that things were not
  

02:01:48.559   02:01:51.700  
and he could tell   that things were not
going    for  

02:01:51.700   02:01:51.710  
   and so he prepared for
  

02:01:51.710   02:01:55.870  
   and so he prepared for 
   well  

02:01:55.870   02:01:55.880  
   it well
  

02:01:55.880   02:01:57.100  
   it well
then     actually     well  

02:01:57.100   02:01:57.110  
then things actually   pretty well
  

02:01:57.110   02:01:59.589  
then things actually   pretty well
for     Noah     and  

02:01:59.589   02:01:59.599  
for Noah   even though the flood came and
  

02:01:59.599   02:02:01.419  
for Noah   even though the flood came and
so     thing     because  

02:02:01.419   02:02:01.429  
so that's an interesting   because
  

02:02:01.429   02:02:04.359  
so that's an interesting   because
that's    issue  

02:02:04.359   02:02:04.369  
that's   a that's an indeterminant issue
  

02:02:04.369   02:02:07.870  
that's   a that's an indeterminant issue
in     existence     hurricane

  to ride them out are you going to
  

02:02:55.679   02:02:57.680  
  to ride them out are you going to
prepare     be  

02:02:57.680   02:02:57.690  
prepare   well the first issue might be
  

02:02:57.690   02:02:59.390  
prepare   well the first issue might be 
   well  

02:02:59.390   02:02:59.400  
   well
  

02:02:59.400   02:03:02.030  
   well
enough     enough  

02:03:02.030   02:03:02.040  
  enough to see them coming with enough
  

02:03:02.040   02:03:03.500  
  enough to see them coming with enough
advance     take  

02:03:03.500   02:03:03.510  
advance warning so   that you can take
  

02:03:03.510   02:03:05.660  
advance warning so   that you can take
proper     step  

02:03:05.660   02:03:05.670  
proper   measures maybe just decide step
  

02:03:05.670   02:03:07.609  
proper   measures maybe just decide step
it    flood  

02:03:07.609   02:03:07.619  
it   maybe just don't go where the flood
  

02:03:07.619   02:03:09.530  
it   maybe just don't go where the flood
is     simple     but  

02:03:09.530   02:03:09.540  
is going to be that's a simple   thing but
  

02:03:09.540   02:03:11.450  
is going to be that's a simple   thing but 
   right  

02:03:11.450   02:03:11.460  
   don't have that luxury right
  

02:03:11.460   02:03:14.060  
   don't have that luxury right
and     catastrophe  

02:03:14.060   02:03:14.070  
and so it is going to   be a catastrophe
  

02:03:14.070   02:03:16.490  
and so it is going to   be a catastrophe 
   to  

02:03:16.490   02:03:16.500  
   in your family is going to
  

02:03:16.500   02:03:19.580  
   in your family is going to
get     really     maybe  

02:03:19.580   02:03:19.590  
   and maybe
  

02:03:19.590   02:03:22.459  
   and maybe
maybe     pathway  

02:03:22.459   02:03:22.469  
maybe there's   just a tiny pathway
  

02:03:22.469   02:03:24.319  
maybe there's   just a tiny pathway
through    doesn't  

02:03:24.319   02:03:24.329

this     in    way  

02:06:57.080   02:06:57.090  
this like someone died in   an ugly way
  

02:06:57.090   02:07:01.040  
this like someone died in   an ugly way
and     God     hell  

02:07:01.040   02:07:01.050  
   it was a hell
  

02:07:01.050   02:07:02.390  
   it was a hell
of     have     been  

02:07:02.390   02:07:02.400  
of a lot better   been
  

02:07:02.400   02:07:04.100  
of a lot better   been
and     the  

02:07:04.100   02:07:04.110  
and maybe it was   good enough that's the
  

02:07:04.110   02:07:06.080  
and maybe it was   good enough that's the
thing     something  

02:07:06.080   02:07:06.090  
  thing you know is that this is something
  

02:07:06.090   02:07:07.959  
  thing you know is that this is something
that     that     if  

02:07:07.959   02:07:07.969  
that   if
  

02:07:07.969   02:07:12.709  
that   if 
   the  

02:07:12.709   02:07:12.719  
   the
  

02:07:12.719   02:07:16.669  
   the
truth     attention     the  

02:07:16.669   02:07:16.679  
   then maybe the
  

02:07:16.679   02:07:18.410  
   then maybe the
tragedy     life  

02:07:18.410   02:07:18.420  
tragedy that's part of life
 

02:07:18.420   02:07:20.990  
tragedy that's part of life
wouldn't     have    the  

02:07:20.990   02:07:21.000  
wouldn't have   into the
  

02:07:21.000   02:07:23.660  
wouldn't have   into the
unbearable     be  

02:07:23.660   02:07:23.670  
unbearable hell that doesn't have to be
 

02:07:23.670   02:07:25.729  
unbearable hell that doesn't have to be
   actually  

02:07:25.729   02:07:25.739  
  part of life and maybe we could actually
  

02:07:25.739   02:07:27.649  
  part of life and maybe we could actually 
   could  

02:07:27.649   02:07:27.659  
  tolerate the tragedy or maybe we could
  

02:07:27.659   02:07:29.060  
  tolerate the tragedy or maybe we could 
   could  

02:07:29.060   02:07:29.070  
   maybe we could
  

02:07:29.070   02:07:30.950  
   maybe we could
even     we  

02:07:30.950   02:07:30.960  
even mitigate it   you don't because we
  

02:07:30.960   02:07:32.450  
even mitigate it   you don't because we
can     the  

02:07:32.450   02:07:32.460  
can we do   that sort of thing all the
  

02:07:32.460   02:07:35.060  
can we do   that sort of thing all the 
   question  

02:07:35.060   02:07:35.070  
   question
  

02:07:35.070   02:07:39.890  
   question
and     very     the  

02:07:39.890   02:07:39.900  
   well are the
  

02:07:39.900   02:07:41.840  
   well are the
floods     that  

02:07:41.840   02:07:41.850  
floods the consequence   of the fact that
  

02:07:41.850   02:07:44.330  
floods the consequence   of the fact that
things     apart     of  

02:07:44.330   02:07:44.340  
   or are the floods of
  

02:07:44.340   02:07:48.709  
   or are the floods of
consequence     the     make  

02:07:48.709   02:07:48.719  
consequence of the   fact that people make
  

02:07:48.719   02:07:50.660  
consequence of the   fact that people make
mistakes     that     shouldn't  

02:07:50.660   02:07:50.670  
mistakes that   they know they shouldn't
  

02:07:50.670   02:07:53.840  
mistakes that   they know they shouldn't
make     and  

02:07:53.840   02:07:53.850  
make and make   anyways they sin right and
  

02:07:53.850   02:07:55.459  
make and make   anyways they sin right and
that's     right     because  

02:07:55.459   02:07:55.469  
that's to miss the mark   because
  

02:07:55.469   02:07:57.140  
that's to miss the mark   because
that's     and     that

   that
  

02:07:57.150   02:07:59.060  
   that
means     don't     the  

02:07:59.060   02:07:59.070  
means maybe they don't   even specify the
  

02:07:59.070   02:08:01.729  
means maybe they don't   even specify the

  and it will certainly come and when it 
   will  

02:10:53.209   02:10:53.219  
   because it will
  

02:10:53.219   02:10:54.860  
   because it will
be     to     do  

02:10:54.860   02:10:54.870  
be up   out what to do
  

02:10:54.870   02:10:56.090  
be up   out what to do
with     just  

02:10:56.090   02:10:56.100  
with the fact that your world just
 

02:10:56.100   02:10:58.879  
with the fact that your world just
   problem  

02:10:58.879   02:10:58.889  
   problem
  

02:10:58.889   02:11:01.760  
   problem
of     severity     will  

02:11:01.760   02:11:01.770  
of ultimate severity   because it will
  

02:11:01.770   02:11:03.800  
of ultimate severity   because it will
push     limits     you'll  

02:11:03.800   02:11:03.810  
push you right   and you'll
  

02:11:03.810   02:11:06.200  
push you right   and you'll
find     unaddressed  

02:11:06.200   02:11:06.210  
find out exactly where your unaddressed
 

02:11:06.210   02:11:09.379  
find out exactly where your unaddressed
   what  

02:11:09.379   02:11:09.389  
  weaknesses lie because that's what
  

02:11:09.389   02:11:11.689  
  weaknesses lie because that's what
happens     reason  

02:11:11.689   02:11:11.699  
happens in a crisis   and so the reason
  

02:11:11.699   02:11:13.609  
happens in a crisis   and so the reason 
   it  

02:11:13.609   02:11:13.619  
   an archetypal reality and it
  

02:11:13.619   02:11:14.930  
   an archetypal reality and it
lurks     entire  

02:11:14.930   02:11:14.940  
lurks   underneath the entire
  

02:11:14.940   02:11:17.270  
lurks   underneath the entire
judeo-christian     apocalypse  

02:11:17.270   02:11:17.280  
judeo-christian structure the apocalypse
 

02:11:17.280   02:11:19.430  
judeo-christian structure the apocalypse
   we  

02:11:19.430   02:11:19.440  
  the impending apocalypse is because we
  

02:11:19.440   02:11:21.709  
  the impending apocalypse is because we
always    and  

02:11:21.709   02:11:21.719  
always   apocalyptic times and
  

02:11:21.719   02:11:24.709  
always   apocalyptic times and
your     ways     and  

02:11:24.709   02:11:24.719  
your world is always   and
  

02:11:24.719   02:11:27.439  
your world is always   and
large     coming     what  

02:11:27.439   02:11:27.449  
large ways coming   and so what
  

02:11:27.449   02:11:30.590  
large ways coming   and so what
do     you     prepare  

02:11:30.590   02:11:30.600  
do you do you   you prepare
  

02:11:30.600   02:11:33.350  
do you do you   you prepare
for     and  

02:11:33.350   02:11:33.360  
for your   world to come to an end and
  

02:11:33.360   02:11:35.570  
for your   world to come to an end and
then     get  

02:11:35.570   02:11:35.580  
then maybe when the end comes   you get
  

02:11:35.580   02:11:42.439  
then maybe when the end comes   you get 
   so  

02:11:42.439   02:11:42.449  
   be a good deal so

the plans you up for that   mine we've
  

02:12:01.850   02:12:03.220  
the plans you up for that   mine we've
spoke     to  

02:12:03.220   02:12:03.230  
spoke briefly last   week and I want to
  

02:12:03.230   02:12:04.810  
spoke briefly last   week and I want to
ask     student     myself  

02:12:04.810   02:12:04.820  
ask you how   such as myself
  

02:12:04.820   02:12:11.320  
ask you how   such as myself
get    well  

02:12:11.320   02:12:11.330  
get   involved with this process yeah well
  

02:12:11.330   02:12:13.410  
get   involved with this process yeah well 
   group  

02:12:13.410   02:12:13.420  
   University that's a group
  

02:12:13.420   02:12:17.200  
   University that's a group
perhaps    but  

02:12:17.200   02:12:17.210  
perhaps   a grandiose ambition right but
  

02:12:17.210   02:12:19.600  
perhaps   a grandiose ambition right but
one     my  

02:12:19.600   02:12:19.610  
one of   the things that so here's my
  

02:12:19.610   02:12:23.770  
one of   the things that so here's my
here's     of  

02:12:23.770   02:12:23.780  
here's my rationale you know lots of
 

02:12:23.780   02:12:25.870  
here's my rationale you know lots of
   in  

02:12:25.870   02:12:25.880  
   in
  

02:12:25.880   02:12:30.780  
   in
the     whole     of  

02:12:30.780   02:12:30.790  
the last 20 years and whole   swathes of
  

02:12:30.790   02:12:32.950  
the last 20 years and whole   swathes of 
   that's  

02:12:32.950   02:12:32.960  
   out that's
  

02:12:32.960   02:12:34.240  
   out that's
happening     rate  

02:12:34.240   02:12:34.250  
happening in a more and   more rapid rate
  

02:12:34.250   02:12:37.240  
happening in a more and   more rapid rate
as     progresses     now  

02:12:37.240   02:12:37.250  
as   right now
  

02:12:37.250   02:12:39.459  
as   right now
newspapers     in     I  

02:12:39.459   02:12:39.469  
newspapers are in   the process of dying I
  

02:12:39.469   02:12:40.990  
newspapers are in   the process of dying I
actually     of  

02:12:40.990   02:12:41.000  
actually think they're in the process   of
  

02:12:41.000   02:12:43.330  
actually think they're in the process   of
committing     they're     the  

02:12:43.330   02:12:43.340  
   in the
  

02:12:43.340   02:12:46.840  
   in the
process     to  

02:12:46.840   02:12:46.850  
process   of dying and that's going to
  

02:12:46.850   02:12:48.280  
process   of dying and that's going to
happen    Globe  

02:12:48.280   02:12:48.290  
happen   very rapidly I think The Globe
  

02:12:48.290   02:12:50.320  
happen   very rapidly I think The Globe
and     readership     in  

02:12:50.320   02:12:50.330  
and Mail lost 10%   in
  

02:12:50.330   02:12:51.729  
and Mail lost 10%   in
the     months     like  

02:12:51.729   02:12:51.739  
the last   something like
  

02:12:51.739   02:12:56.459  
the last   something like 
   new  

02:12:56.459   02:12:56.469  
  that and so what happens is that new
  

02:12:56.469   02:12:58.630  
  that and so what happens is that new
technologies     the  

02:12:58.630   02:12:58.640  
technologies come along to supplant the
 

02:12:58.640   02:13:00.939  
technologies come along to supplant the
old     a 

02:13:00.939   02:13:00.949  
old technologies and I've watched a
 

02:13:00.949   02:13:02.830  
old technologies and I've watched a
   large  

02:13:02.830   02:13:02.840  
  number of businesses fail some large
  

02:13:02.840   02:13:05.800  
  number of businesses fail some large
businesses     worked  

02:13:05.800   02:13:05.810  
businesses   I knew some people who worked
  

02:13:05.810   02:13:07.510  
businesses   I knew some people who worked
at     Equipment     it  

02:13:07.510   02:13:07.520  
at Digital Equipment   Corporation when it
  

02:13:07.520   02:13:08.979  
at Digital Equipment   Corporation when it
was     and     inside  

02:13:08.979   02:13:08.989  
was failing and   I've had some inside
  

02:13:08.989   02:13:11.650  
was failing and   I've had some inside
track    see  

02:13:11.650   02:13:11.660  
track   into failing businesses and I see
  

02:13:11.660   02:13:13.720  
track   into failing businesses and I see
when     the  

02:13:13.720   02:13:13.730  
when they start to fail they tend to the
 

02:13:13.730   02:13:15.520  
when they start to fail they tend to the
   then  

02:13:15.520   02:13:15.530  
  failure process tends to cap and then
  

02:13:15.530   02:13:17.380  
  failure process tends to cap and then
accelerate     unbelievably     good  

02:13:17.380   02:13:17.390  
accelerate   good
  

02:13:17.390   02:13:19.420  
accelerate   good

time these don't watch well one of the
 

02:19:43.240   02:19:44.849  
time these don't watch well one of the
   is  

02:19:44.849   02:19:44.859  
   do for example is
  

02:19:44.859   02:19:47.879  
   do for example is
imagine     are     so  

02:19:47.879   02:19:47.889  
imagine   so
  

02:19:47.889   02:19:50.340  
imagine   so
you     let's     a  

02:19:50.340   02:19:50.350  
you have taken exam let's   say it's a
  

02:19:50.350   02:19:51.960  
you have taken exam let's   say it's a 
   sake  

02:19:51.960   02:19:51.970  
   just for the sake
  

02:19:51.970   02:19:54.809  
   just for the sake
of     the  

02:19:54.809   02:19:54.819  
of argument because they're simpler the
 

02:19:54.819   02:19:57.450  
of argument because they're simpler the
writing     problem    well  

02:19:57.450   02:19:57.460  
writing issue is a separate problem   well
  

02:19:57.460   02:20:00.599  
writing issue is a separate problem   well
so     one     do  

02:20:00.599   02:20:00.609  
so one   do
  

02:20:00.609   02:20:01.830  
so one   do
if     is

  you've acquired get a hundred people to
do     get     test  

02:20:34.019   02:20:34.029  
do   the test
  

02:20:34.029   02:20:35.580  
do   the test
construction     keep  

02:20:35.580   02:20:35.590  
construction and then you can keep
 

02:20:35.590   02:20:37.050  
construction and then you can keep
   as  

02:20:37.050   02:20:37.060  
  making the test better and better as
  

02:20:37.060   02:20:38.460  
  making the test better and better as
well     could     I'd  

02:20:38.460   02:20:38.470  
well because you could   that I'd
  

02:20:38.470   02:20:39.990  
well because you could   that I'd
like     so     was  

02:20:39.990   02:20:40.000  
like   it was
  

02:20:40.000   02:20:42.030  
like   it was
self     of  

02:20:42.030   02:20:42.040  
self improving with a minimum of
 

02:20:42.040   02:20:45.570  
self improving with a minimum of
administrative     and    so  

02:20:45.570   02:20:45.580  
administrative interference and   so
  

02:20:45.580   02:20:47.430  
administrative interference and   so 
   you  

02:20:47.430   02:20:47.440  
   as you
  

02:20:47.440   02:20:49.500  
   as you
got     writing  

02:20:49.500   02:20:49.510  
got accredited so you start writing
 

02:20:49.510   02:20:51.180  
got accredited so you start writing
exams     more    of  

02:20:51.180   02:20:51.190  
exams and maybe write more   more of
  

02:20:51.190   02:20:53.220  
exams and maybe write more   more of
them     by     power  

02:20:53.220   02:20:53.230  
them then you'd start   voting power
  

02:20:53.230   02:20:54.690  
them then you'd start   voting power
with     of     the  

02:20:54.690   02:20:54.700  
with regards   the
  

02:20:54.700   02:20:56.490  
with regards   the 
   to  

02:20:56.490   02:20:56.500  
   and maybe even the right to
  

02:20:56.500   02:20:58.890  
   and maybe even the right to
produce     so  

02:20:58.890   02:20:58.900  
produce courses to put them up online   so
  

02:20:58.900   02:21:00.720  
produce courses to put them up online   so 
   our  

02:21:00.720   02:21:00.730  
   like that but our
  

02:21:00.730   02:21:03.360

partner the   guy who helped me develop
  

02:22:14.050   02:22:15.540  
partner the   guy who helped me develop
the     program     which  

02:22:15.540   02:22:15.550  
the self authoring program   which
  

02:22:15.550   02:22:17.490  
the self authoring program   which
thousands     now  

02:22:17.490   02:22:17.500  
thousands of people are using   that now
  

02:22:17.500   02:22:20.340  
thousands of people are using   that now 
   thousands  

02:22:20.340   02:22:20.350  
  and we've helped thousands of thousands
  

02:22:20.350   02:22:22.051  
  and we've helped thousands of thousands 
   university  

02:22:22.051   02:22:22.061  
  of students now stay in the university
  

02:22:22.061   02:22:24.090  
  of students now stay in the university
so     that's     not  

02:22:24.090   02:22:24.100  
so that's   really cool well maybe not
  

02:22:24.100   02:22:27.480  
so that's   really cool well maybe not 
   I'm  

02:22:27.480   02:22:27.490  
   university I'm
  

02:22:27.490   02:22:29.640  
   university I'm
contributing     to     know  

02:22:29.640   02:22:29.650  
contributing   problem but you know
  

02:22:29.650   02:22:32.220  
contributing   problem but you know
but     but     out  

02:22:32.220   02:22:32.230  
but they're but   they're sticking out
  

02:22:32.230   02:22:33.750  
but they're but   they're sticking out
their     that's     they're  

02:22:33.750   02:22:33.760  
their plans   the point they're
  

02:22:33.760   02:22:35.220  
their plans   the point they're

actually making   plans and sticking them 
   we  

02:22:39.180   02:22:39.190  
  out so so I think that we can and we
  

02:22:39.190   02:22:41.460  
  out so so I think that we can and we 
   the  

02:22:41.460   02:22:41.470  
   start small with because the
  

02:22:41.470   02:22:42.870  
   start small with because the
way     a  

02:22:42.870   02:22:42.880  
way to build a big system is to build a
 

02:22:42.880   02:22:44.580  
way to build a big system is to build a
small   scale  

02:22:44.580   02:22:44.590  
small   system that works and then scale
  

02:22:44.590   02:22:48.360  
small   system that works and then scale
it     with  

02:22:48.360   02:22:48.370  
it   and so that's I've been talking with
  

02:22:48.370   02:22:50.100  
it   and so that's I've been talking with
my     name     Higgins

there's the neuroscientist a while back

stroke   and she being a neuroscientist
  

02:30:50.841   02:30:53.801  
stroke   and she being a neuroscientist
was     neurological  

02:30:53.801   02:30:53.811  
was analyzing   the neurological

was analyzing   the neurological
consequences     it  

02:30:55.690   02:30:55.700  
consequences   of the stroke as it
  

02:30:55.700   02:30:58.541  
consequences   of the stroke as it
occurred     the  

02:30:58.541   02:30:58.551  
occurred   if I remember correctly the

sense   of identity shifting from that
sort     boundaries     you  

02:31:22.390   02:31:22.400  
sort   maybe that you

physical   that was
  

02:31:27.290   02:31:30.881  
physical   that was
much     broader     it  

02:31:30.881   02:31:30.891

that     about

that might be one   way of thinking about

that might be one   way of thinking about

   about consciousness
  

02:31:49.851   02:31:51.551  
   about consciousness 
   anything  

02:31:51.551   02:31:51.561  
   we know anything
  

02:31:51.561   02:31:53.501  
   we know anything 
   obviously

02:31:53.511   02:31:55.030  
   and obviously
consciousness     something     all  

02:31:55.030   02:31:55.040  
consciousness is something   that we all
  

02:31:55.040   02:31:57.511

seem   individually but
maybe     are  

02:32:03.310   02:32:03.320  
maybe our   individual consciousnesses are
  

02:32:03.320   02:32:05.171  
maybe our   individual consciousnesses are
something     of  

02:32:05.171   02:32:05.181  
something like   the manifestations of
  

02:32:05.181   02:32:07.001  
something like   the manifestations of
something     unified  

02:32:07.001   02:32:07.011  
something   that's a more unified
  

02:32:07.011   02:32:08.740  
something   that's a more unified
consciousness     that's  

02:32:08.740   02:32:08.750  
consciousness underneath I mean that's

consciousness underneath I mean that's
   seem  

02:32:11.740   02:32:11.750  
   but it does seem
  

02:32:11.750   02:32:13.060  
   but it does seem

well how do you know   something's a
delusion     and     be  

02:32:33.970   02:32:33.980  
delusion   the answer that has to be
  

02:32:33.980   02:32:36.220  
delusion   the answer that has to be
like    anyone  

02:32:36.220   02:32:36.230  
like   something like well hardly anyone

for obvious   reasons haha I'll tell you
something     it's  

02:33:13.780   02:33:13.790  
something really   funny I think it's
  

02:33:13.790   02:33:16.450  
something really   funny I think it's
funny     old  

02:33:16.450   02:33:16.460  
funny anyways I had Timothy Leary's old
 

02:33:16.460   02:33:20.620  
funny anyways I had Timothy Leary's old
job     and    Leary  

02:33:20.620   02:33:20.630  
job at Harvard so you know and   Leary
  

02:33:20.630   02:33:22.330  
job at Harvard so you know and   Leary
is     very  

02:33:22.330   02:33:22.340  
is a good object lesson and being very
 

02:33:22.340   02:33:23.769  
is a good object lesson and being very
   because  

02:33:23.769   02:33:23.779  
  careful about this sort of thing because
  

02:33:23.779   02:33:30.340  
  careful about this sort of thing because 
   his  

02:33:30.340   02:33:30.350  
  it certainly it isn't obvious that his
  

02:33:30.350   02:33:34.090  
  it certainly it isn't obvious that his
net     with  

02:33:34.090   02:33:34.100  
net effect was good and   I say that with
  

02:33:34.100   02:33:35.590  
net effect was good and   I say that with
some    very  

02:33:35.590   02:33:35.600  
some   a very
  

02:33:35.600   02:33:37.000  
some   a very
smart     creative  

02:33:37.000   02:33:37.010  
smart person   and he was very creative
  

02:33:37.010   02:33:39.610  
smart person   and he was very creative 
   that  

02:33:39.610   02:33:39.620  
  but he got tangled up in that
  

02:33:39.620   02:33:41.920  
  but he got tangled up in that
hallucinogenic     that  

02:33:41.920   02:33:41.930  
hallucinogenic madhouse   you know that
  

02:33:41.930   02:33:44.080  
hallucinogenic madhouse   you know that
that     period  

02:33:44.080   02:33:44.090  
that characterized the   say the period
  

02:33:44.090   02:33:47.860  
that characterized the   say the period
from     didn't  

02:33:47.860   02:33:47.870  
from 1965 to   about 1970 and it didn't
  

02:33:47.870   02:33:49.599  
from 1965 to   about 1970 and it didn't
seem     that     a  

02:33:49.599   02:33:49.609  
seem to   a
  

02:33:49.609   02:33:51.700  
seem to   a
good     these  

02:33:51.700   02:33:51.710  
good thing   thing is we have these
  

02:33:51.710   02:33:54.280  
good thing   thing is we have these
chemicals     people  

02:33:54.280   02:33:54.290  
chemicals now in our   culture and people
  

02:33:54.290   02:33:56.950  
chemicals now in our   culture and people
are     mad     and  

02:33:56.950   02:33:56.960  
are experimenting   and
  

02:33:56.960   02:33:59.019  
are experimenting   and 
   be  

02:33:59.019   02:33:59.029  
  making them illegal doesn't seem to be
  

02:33:59.029   02:34:02.110  
  making them illegal doesn't seem to be
working     because     I  

02:34:02.110   02:34:02.120  
working   I
  

02:34:02.120   02:34:05.200  
working   I
think     to
