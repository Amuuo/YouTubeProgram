00:01:49.080   00:01:49.090  
ambivalent   pathway through life and it's
  

00:01:49.090   00:01:50.190  
ambivalent   pathway through life and it's
one     I     so  

00:01:50.190   00:01:50.200  
one   think so
  

00:01:50.200   00:01:52.890  
one   think so
interesting     about     in  

00:01:52.890   00:01:52.900  
interesting   stories in the in
  

00:01:52.900   00:01:57.600  
interesting   stories in the in
the     that     so  

00:01:57.600   00:01:57.610  
the Old Testament   these so
  

00:01:57.610   00:01:59.970  
the Old Testament   these so
called     are     very  

00:01:59.970   00:01:59.980  
   very
  

00:01:59.980   00:02:03.090  
   very
realistic    was  

00:02:03.090   00:02:03.100  
realistic   and it's something that I was
  

00:02:03.100   00:02:05.130  
realistic   and it's something that I was
also     in  

00:02:05.130   00:02:05.140  
also   being struck by that accounts in
  

00:02:05.140   00:02:07.080  
also   being struck by that accounts in
the     Testament     lots  

00:02:07.080   00:02:07.090  
the New Testament   that way there's lots
  

00:02:07.090   00:02:10.619  
the New Testament   that way there's lots
of     that     you'd  

00:02:10.619   00:02:10.629  
of things that   Christ does that you'd
  

00:02:10.629   00:02:12.180  
of things that   Christ does that you'd
think     would     over  

00:02:12.180   00:02:12.190  
think would   out over
  

00:02:12.190   00:02:14.190  
think would   out over
time     and  

00:02:14.190   00:02:14.200  
time   and sanitized but they're not and
  

00:02:14.200   00:02:15.509  
time   and sanitized but they're not and
that     Testament     not  

00:02:15.509   00:02:15.519  
that the Old Testament   is definitely not
  

00:02:15.519   00:02:17.130  
that the Old Testament   is definitely not
a     been     that's  

00:02:17.130   00:02:17.140  
a book that's   sanitized and that's
  

00:02:17.140   00:02:17.780  
a book that's   sanitized and that's 
  it 

00:02:17.780   00:02:17.790  
  it
  

00:02:17.790   00:02:19.069  
  it
quite     case  

00:02:19.069   00:02:19.079  
quite   interesting that that's the case
  

00:02:19.079   00:02:22.250  
quite   interesting that that's the case
so    their  

00:02:22.250   00:02:22.260  
   with all their
  

00:02:22.260   00:02:26.330  
   with all their 
   also  

00:02:26.330   00:02:26.340  
   also
  

00:02:26.340   00:02:29.709  
   also
derive     general     about  

00:02:29.709   00:02:29.719  
derive some general   conclusions about
  

00:02:29.719   00:02:32.750  
derive some general   conclusions about
them     the  

00:02:32.750   00:02:32.760  
them the moral of the   story of the
  

00:02:32.760   00:02:35.300  
them the moral of the   story of the
Genesis     these  

00:02:35.300   00:02:35.310  
Genesis stories and because these
 

00:02:35.310   00:02:37.069  
Genesis stories and because these
   and  

00:02:37.069   00:02:37.079  
  stories are fundamentally moral and
  

00:02:37.079   00:02:39.080  
  stories are fundamentally moral and
moral     do  

00:02:39.080   00:02:39.090  
moral as far as I'm concerned has to do
 

00:02:39.090   00:02:42.259  
moral as far as I'm concerned has to do
with     moral 

00:02:42.259   00:02:42.269  
with action right because moral
 

00:02:42.269   00:02:43.879  
with action right because moral
decisions     that    you  

00:02:43.879   00:02:43.889  
decisions are the decisions that   you
  

00:02:43.889   00:02:45.949  
decisions are the decisions that   you
make     when  

00:02:45.949   00:02:45.959  
  make when you're structuring action when
  

00:02:45.959   00:02:47.770  
  make when you're structuring action when 
   another  

00:02:47.770   00:02:47.780  
  you decide to do one thing or another
  

00:02:47.780   00:02:50.089  
  you decide to do one thing or another 
   are  

00:02:50.089   00:02:50.099  
  generally you want to do things that are
  

00:02:50.099   00:02:52.280  
  generally you want to do things that are
the     you     to

the   can think of to

the   can think of to
do     also  

00:02:56.000   00:02:56.010  
do and hence good but sometimes   you also
  

00:02:56.010   00:02:57.229  
do and hence good but sometimes   you also
want     do     worse  

00:02:57.229   00:02:57.239  
want to do   they're worse
  

00:02:57.239   00:02:58.729  
want to do   they're worse
things     do     because  

00:02:58.729   00:02:58.739  
things   you know because
  

00:02:58.739   00:03:01.429  
things   you know because
you're    and  

00:03:01.429   00:03:01.439  
you're   angry or resentful or bitter and
  

00:03:01.439   00:03:03.649  
you're   angry or resentful or bitter and
so     make  

00:03:03.649   00:03:03.659  
so the moral decisions that you make
 

00:03:03.659   00:03:06.020  
so the moral decisions that you make
that     are    the  

00:03:06.020   00:03:06.030  
that govern your actions are   really the

   that you make
in     and     to

  making decisions about empirical reality
which     ways     simpler  

00:03:24.610   00:03:24.620  
which in some ways   seem a lot simpler
  

00:03:24.620   00:03:26.689  
which in some ways   seem a lot simpler 
   collectively  

00:03:26.689   00:03:26.699  
   because we can work collectively
  

00:03:26.699   00:03:28.129  
   because we can work collectively
at     partly     rigorous

  really struck me like it's an
overarching     the  

00:03:37.670   00:03:37.680  
overarching   theme I would say that the

patriarchs that we've talked   about

   now that's in in
in     Testament     that's  

00:04:25.820   00:04:25.830  
in the Old   stories that's
  

00:04:25.830   00:04:29.000  
in the Old   stories that's
basically     the  

00:04:29.000   00:04:29.010  
basically portrayed as   harkening to the
  

00:04:29.010   00:04:30.890  
basically portrayed as   harkening to the
voice     of     maybe  

00:04:30.890   00:04:30.900  
voice of   that maybe
  

00:04:30.900   00:04:31.650  
voice of   that maybe 
   about  

00:04:31.650   00:04:31.660  
   think about
  

00:04:31.660   00:04:33.920  
   think about 
   calling  

00:04:33.920   00:04:33.930  
  his destiny or a psychological calling
  

00:04:33.930   00:04:37.380  
  his destiny or a psychological calling 
   it's  

00:04:37.380   00:04:37.390  
   too is is that it's
  

00:04:37.390   00:04:39.120  
   too is is that it's 
   time  

00:04:39.120   00:04:39.130  
   have an easy time
  

00:04:39.130   00:04:42.750  
   have an easy time
of     what's  

00:04:42.750   00:04:42.760  
of it when they heed that call so what's
 

00:04:42.760   00:04:45.300  
of it when they heed that call so what's
what's     is    often  

00:04:45.300   00:04:45.310  
what's fascinating is   often
  

00:04:45.310   00:04:47.610  
what's fascinating is   often
run     away  

00:04:47.610   00:04:47.620  
run into extreme difficulties   right away
  

00:04:47.620   00:04:49.470  
run into extreme difficulties   right away
and     that's     interesting  

00:04:49.470   00:04:49.480  
and I   very interesting
  

00:04:49.480   00:04:52.110  
and I   very interesting 
   obviously  

00:04:52.110   00:04:52.120  
   of all because life is obviously
  

00:04:52.120   00:04:55.470  
   of all because life is obviously 
   second  

00:04:55.470   00:04:55.480  
  full of extreme difficulties and second
  

00:04:55.480   00:04:57.690  
  full of extreme difficulties and second
it's     another     to  

00:04:57.690   00:04:57.700  
it's another   to
  

00:04:57.700   00:05:00.060  
it's another   to
sugarcoat    the  

00:05:00.060   00:05:00.070  
sugarcoat   things which is one of the
  

00:05:00.070   00:05:03.390  
sugarcoat   things which is one of the
things    anti  

00:05:03.390   00:05:03.400  
things   mockery of anti
  

00:05:03.400   00:05:04.800  
things   mockery of anti
religious     theories     quite  

00:05:04.800   00:05:04.810  
   are even quite
  

00:05:04.810   00:05:07.200  
   are even quite 
   because  

00:05:07.200   00:05:07.210  
  sophisticated say like Freud's because
  

00:05:07.210   00:05:10.080  
  sophisticated say like Freud's because
Freud     a     it  

00:05:10.080   00:05:10.090  
Freud thought of religion as   it
  

00:05:10.090   00:05:12.180  
Freud thought of religion as   it
was     and  

00:05:12.180   00:05:12.190  
  was a wish fulfillment essentially and
  

00:05:12.190   00:05:15.750  
  was a wish fulfillment essentially and
and     thought     religion  

00:05:15.750   00:05:15.760  
and also Marx who thought   about religion
  

00:05:15.760   00:05:18.600  
and also Marx who thought   about religion
as     masses     if  

00:05:18.600   00:05:18.610  
as the opiate of the masses   it's if
  

00:05:18.610   00:05:20.790  
as the opiate of the masses   it's if
those     me     that  

00:05:20.790   00:05:20.800  
those were true it seems   that
  

00:05:20.800   00:05:23.340  
those were true it seems   that
there'd     more     lot  

00:05:23.340   00:05:23.350  
there'd be a lot   wish and a lot
  

00:05:23.350   00:05:25.620  
there'd be a lot   wish and a lot
less     harsh  

00:05:25.620   00:05:25.630  
less reality   a lot less stark harsh
  

00:05:25.630   00:05:27.840  
less reality   a lot less stark harsh
reality     thing     that  

00:05:27.840   00:05:27.850  
reality you know   that
  

00:05:27.850   00:05:32.060  
reality you know   that 
   then  

00:05:32.060   00:05:32.070  
  Abraham encounters is a famine and then
  

00:05:32.070   00:05:35.910  
  Abraham encounters is a famine and then
he     he  

00:05:35.910   00:05:35.920  
he has   to hide his wife and then he he
  

00:05:35.920   00:05:38.460  
he has   to hide his wife and then he he
basically     journeys     so  

00:05:38.460   00:05:38.470  
basically   into a tyranny so
  

00:05:38.470   00:05:40.530  
basically   into a tyranny so
that's     some  

00:05:40.530   00:05:40.540  
  that's about as bad as it gets in some
  

00:05:40.540   00:05:43.770  
  that's about as bad as it gets in some
ways     themes     continually  

00:05:43.770   00:05:43.780  
ways and those themes   recur continually
  

00:05:43.780   00:05:45.390  
ways and those themes   recur continually 
   they're  

00:05:45.390   00:05:45.400  
  and no one ever lives where they're
  

00:05:45.400   00:05:46.800  
  and no one ever lives where they're 
   in  

00:05:46.800   00:05:46.810  
  supposed to live they'll even live in
  

00:05:46.810   00:05:49.200  
  supposed to live they'll even live in 
   so  

00:05:49.200   00:05:49.210  
  Canaan and not the promised land and so
  

00:05:49.210   00:05:51.420  
  Canaan and not the promised land and so
it's     rough  

00:05:51.420   00:05:51.430  
it's a pretty   rough it's a pretty rough
  

00:05:51.430   00:05:54.659  
it's a pretty   rough it's a pretty rough

   to go
out     engage     then

out into the   and then
  

00:06:02.530   00:06:05.250  
out into the   and then
there's     hints     proper

clearly     the     I  

00:06:10.650   00:06:10.660  
clearly   improper way to engage is I
  

00:06:10.660   00:06:12.659  
clearly   improper way to engage is I
think     clearly     the  

00:06:12.659   00:06:12.669  
think most clearly   delineated in the
  

00:06:12.669   00:06:16.909  
think most clearly   delineated in the 
   Cain  

00:06:16.909   00:06:16.919  
  Cain and Abel story and with Cain
  

00:06:16.919   00:06:19.770  
  Cain and Abel story and with Cain
exemplifying     to  

00:06:19.770   00:06:19.780  
exemplifying the inappropriate way to
 

00:06:19.780   00:06:21.750  
exemplifying the inappropriate way to
engage   to  

00:06:21.750   00:06:21.760  
engage   that's to
  

00:06:21.760   00:06:25.380  
engage   that's to
engage     the     bitter  

00:06:25.380   00:06:25.390  
engage with the   world in a bitter
  

00:06:25.390   00:06:28.860  
engage with the   world in a bitter
jealous     now     of  

00:06:28.860   00:06:28.870  
jealous and resentful manner   one of

jealous and resentful manner   one of 
   the  

00:06:30.240   00:06:30.250  
  the things that I really like about the
  

00:06:30.250   00:06:31.950  
  the things that I really like about the
Cain     theme  

00:06:31.950   00:06:31.960  
Cain and Abel story and that theme
 

00:06:31.960   00:06:34.140  
Cain and Abel story and that theme
recurs     the 

00:06:34.140   00:06:34.150  
recurs continually with the with the
 

00:06:34.150   00:06:35.850  
recurs continually with the with the
duality     of    there's  

00:06:35.850   00:06:35.860  
duality of   the brothers right there's
  

00:06:35.860   00:06:38.600  
duality of   the brothers right there's
there's     a  

00:06:38.600   00:06:38.610  
there's constant conflict between   a
  

00:06:38.610   00:06:40.500  
there's constant conflict between   a
perspective     like  

00:06:40.500   00:06:40.510  
perspective   that's essentially like
  

00:06:40.510   00:06:42.690  
perspective   that's essentially like 
   opposite  

00:06:42.690   00:06:42.700

00:07:44.030   00:07:46.390  
  its laid at his own feet
but     you  

00:07:46.390   00:07:46.400  
but he's definitely failing and so you

those     also  

00:08:33.070   00:08:33.080  
  those sorts of pitfalls and I do also
  

00:08:33.080   00:08:34.719  
  those sorts of pitfalls and I do also
think     that  

00:08:34.719   00:08:34.729  
think   that its pitfalls like that that
  

00:08:34.729   00:08:36.219  
think   that its pitfalls like that that 
   now

now     doesn't     no  

00:08:52.570   00:08:52.580  
now that doesn't   mean there's no
  

00:08:52.580   00:08:54.010  
now that doesn't   mean there's no
disparity     but     always  

00:08:54.010   00:08:54.020  
disparity there's but   there's always

on 

00:08:58.940   00:08:58.950  
on
 

00:08:58.950   00:09:02.390  
on
   with  

00:09:02.390   00:09:02.400  
  see so and so the and Jacob ends up with
  

00:09:02.400   00:09:06.620  
  see so and so the and Jacob ends up with
with     blessing     that's  

00:09:06.620   00:09:06.630  
with with Isaac's blessing   and so that's
  

00:09:06.630   00:09:10.700  
with with Isaac's blessing   and so that's
that's     he  

00:09:10.700   00:09:10.710  
that's a moral   catastrophe and then he
  

00:09:10.710   00:09:12.470  
that's a moral   catastrophe and then he
has     because     to  

00:09:12.470   00:09:12.480  
has to run because   his brother wants to
  

00:09:12.480   00:09:13.130  
has to run because   his brother wants to 
   him  

00:09:13.130   00:09:13.140  
  kill him
  

00:09:13.140   00:09:16.550  
  kill him
and    motif  

00:09:16.550   00:09:16.560  
and   so that's the fratricidal motif
  

00:09:16.560   00:09:18.260  
and   so that's the fratricidal motif
again    that's  

00:09:18.260   00:09:18.270  
again   that's
  

00:09:18.270   00:09:20.720  
again   that's
real     one     of  

00:09:20.720   00:09:20.730  
real really realistic you know   of
  

00:09:20.730   00:09:22.610  
real really realistic you know   of
the     constantly  

00:09:22.610   00:09:22.620  
the things that Freud noted constantly

the things that Freud noted constantly
and     a 

00:09:24.080   00:09:24.090  
and this is where Freud really is a
 

00:09:24.090   00:09:28.010  
and this is where Freud really is a
genius   hatreds  

00:09:28.010   00:09:28.020  
genius   that the most intense hatreds
  

00:09:28.020   00:09:30.230

in     world     brothers  

00:10:11.930   00:10:11.940

can     think

can   be at each other's throats I think
is     that's     it's  

00:10:18.110   00:10:18.120  
is that's   a very powerful idea and it's
  

00:10:18.120   00:10:19.520  
is that's   a very powerful idea and it's
not     that     think

   think
  

00:10:19.530   00:10:22.850  
   think
about     it's

  about so so Jacob has to leave and it's

one of   the things I think it does is
  

00:10:38.730   00:10:40.820  
one of   the things I think it does is
give     it     to

   and enlightens you or a
destructive     kind  

00:14:13.710   00:14:13.720  
destructive path and I think it's   kind
  

00:14:13.720   00:14:15.749  
destructive path and I think it's   kind
of    the  

00:14:15.749   00:14:15.759  
of   that maybe the
  

00:14:15.759   00:14:17.910  
of   that maybe the
dichotomy    might  

00:14:17.910   00:14:17.920  
dichotomy   between those two paths might
  

00:14:17.920   00:14:21.990  
dichotomy   between those two paths might
be     real     that  

00:14:21.990   00:14:22.000  
be real   you know and and because that
  

00:14:22.000   00:14:24.499  
be real   you know and and because that
also     your  

00:14:24.499   00:14:24.509  
also allows you to give credence   to your
  

00:14:24.509   00:14:27.600  
also allows you to give credence   to your 
   but  

00:14:27.600   00:14:27.610  
   of thing but
  

00:14:27.610   00:14:29.100  
   of thing but
I     it's  

00:14:29.100   00:14:29.110  
I don't   anyways I don't think it's
  

00:14:29.110   00:14:30.870  
I don't   anyways I don't think it's
unreasonable     you're  

00:14:30.870   00:14:30.880  
  unreasonable to posit that since you're
  

00:14:30.880   00:14:34.230  
  unreasonable to posit that since you're
alive     possible  

00:14:34.230   00:14:34.240  
alive   adopting the highest possible
  

00:14:34.240   00:14:36.180  
alive   adopting the highest possible
regard     alive  

00:14:36.180   00:14:36.190  
regard for the fact that you're alive
 

00:14:36.190   00:14:38.069  
regard for the fact that you're alive
   other  

00:14:38.069   00:14:38.079  
  and that you're surrounded by other
  

00:14:38.079   00:14:40.259  
  and that you're surrounded by other
creatures    can't  

00:14:40.259   00:14:40.269  
creatures   that are alive I just can't
  

00:14:40.269   00:14:42.030  
creatures   that are alive I just can't
see     be     construed  

00:14:42.030   00:14:42.040  
see how   construed
  

00:14:42.040   00:14:44.610  
see how   construed
as     the  

00:14:44.610   00:14:44.620  
as   a losing strategy and so that's the
  

00:14:44.620   00:14:45.870  
as   a losing strategy and so that's the 
   like  

00:14:45.870   00:14:45.880  
  first thing so that's something like
  

00:14:45.880   00:14:48.420  
  first thing so that's something like
faith     not  

00:14:48.420   00:14:48.430  
  faith right it's faith it's not it's not
  

00:14:48.430   00:14:50.490  
  faith right it's faith it's not it's not
only     faith  

00:14:50.490   00:14:50.500  
only   faith in your being but it's faith
  

00:14:50.500   00:14:52.500  
only   faith in your being but it's faith
in     would     be  

00:14:52.500   00:14:52.510  
in being as such and the faith would   be
  

00:14:52.510   00:14:55.650  
in being as such and the faith would   be
something    your  

00:14:55.650   00:14:55.660  
something   your
  

00:14:55.660   00:14:57.930  
something   your
being     would  

00:14:57.930   00:14:57.940  
being properly   then maybe that would
  

00:14:57.940   00:15:01.259  
being properly   then maybe that would
orient     such     you  

00:15:01.259   00:15:01.269  
orient you with   you
  

00:15:01.269   00:15:04.400  
orient you with   you
never     might     true  

00:15:04.400   00:15:04.410  
never know like   be true
  

00:15:04.410   00:15:06.569  
never know like   be true 
   it  

00:15:06.569   00:15:06.579  
   that it
  

00:15:06.579   00:15:08.879  
   that it
wouldn't     just  

00:15:08.879   00:15:08.889  
wouldn't   be true I mean even if you just
  

00:15:08.889   00:15:10.949  
wouldn't   be true I mean even if you just
take     biological     on  

00:15:10.949   00:15:10.959  
take a strict biological   perspective on
  

00:15:10.959   00:15:12.660  
take a strict biological   perspective on
this     product  

00:15:12.660   00:15:12.670  
this   and think about us as the product
  

00:15:12.670   00:15:14.460  
this   and think about us as the product
of    of  

00:15:14.460   00:15:14.470  
of   three and a half billion years of
  

00:15:14.470   00:15:17.850  
of   three and a half billion years of
evolution     over  

00:15:17.850   00:15:17.860  
evolution I mean we have struggled   over
  

00:15:17.860   00:15:20.189  
evolution I mean we have struggled   over
all     those     alive  

00:15:20.189   00:15:20.199  
   billions of years to be alive
  

00:15:20.199   00:15:22.920  
   billions of years to be alive
and     and  

00:15:22.920   00:15:22.930  
and to match ourselves with reality and
 

00:15:22.930   00:15:25.319  
and to match ourselves with reality and
so     of    often  

00:15:25.319   00:15:25.329  
so because one of   the things I've often
  

00:15:25.329   00:15:27.389  
so because one of   the things I've often
wondered     life     definitely  

00:15:27.389   00:15:27.399  
wondered is you know life   is definitely
  

00:15:27.399   00:15:29.160  
wondered is you know life   is definitely 
   that  

00:15:29.160   00:15:29.170  
   about that
  

00:15:29.170   00:15:30.600  
   about that 
   inequality  

00:15:30.600   00:15:30.610  
   that's unfair and there's inequality
  

00:15:30.610   00:15:32.370  
   that's unfair and there's inequality 
   are  

00:15:32.370   00:15:32.380  
  and all of those things and people are
  

00:15:32.380   00:15:34.199  
  and all of those things and people are
subject    things  

00:15:34.199   00:15:34.209  
subject   to all sorts of terrible things
  

00:15:34.209   00:15:37.829  
subject   to all sorts of terrible things
but     weren't  

00:15:37.829   00:15:37.839  
but I also wonder if you weren't
 

00:15:37.839   00:15:40.020  
but I also wonder if you weren't
actively     striving    things  

00:15:40.020   00:15:40.030  
actively striving   to make things

actively striving   to make things
worse     be  

00:15:43.110   00:15:43.120  
worse just how much better could   they be
  

00:15:43.120   00:15:48.150  
worse just how much better could   they be
you     they  

00:15:48.150   00:15:48.160  
you   know because people are very they
  

00:15:48.160   00:15:50.490  
you   know because people are very they

   very ambivalent 
   maybe  

00:16:36.720   00:16:36.730  
  and you can make the case that maybe
  

00:16:36.730   00:16:37.860  
  and you can make the case that maybe
it's    never

it's   something that should have never

it's   something that should have never

00:16:38.610   00:16:38.620  
happened
 

00:16:38.620   00:16:40.860  
happened
but     seem    productive  

00:16:40.860   00:16:40.870  
but that doesn't seem   productive
  

00:16:40.870   00:16:43.230  
but that doesn't seem   productive
to    to  

00:16:43.230   00:16:43.240  
to   going to
  

00:16:43.240   00:16:45.780  
to   going to
act     ultimately  

00:16:45.780   00:16:45.790  
act as if being is ultimately
 

00:16:45.790   00:16:48.150  
act as if being is ultimately
justifiable   it  

00:16:48.150   00:16:48.160  
justifiable   and that if I partake in it
  

00:16:48.160   00:16:50.310  
justifiable   and that if I partake in it
properly    than  

00:16:50.310   00:16:50.320  
properly   will improve it rather than
  

00:16:50.320   00:16:52.830  
properly   will improve it rather than
making     the  

00:16:52.830   00:16:52.840  
making it worse   so I think that's the
  

00:16:52.840   00:16:54.990  
making it worse   so I think that's the 
   seems  

00:16:54.990   00:16:55.000  
   of faith and then what seems
  

00:16:55.000   00:16:57.470  
   of faith and then what seems
to     along     like  

00:16:57.470   00:16:57.480  
to   with that is something like
  

00:16:57.480   00:17:01.530  
to   with that is something like
truth     conception     know  

00:17:01.530   00:17:01.540  
truth in conception   and action you know
  

00:17:01.540   00:17:04.440  
truth in conception   and action you know
even     people     pretty  

00:17:04.440   00:17:04.450  
even people   like Jacob who are pretty
  

00:17:04.450   00:17:06.450  
even people   like Jacob who are pretty 
   with  

00:17:06.450   00:17:06.460  
  damn morally ambivalent to begin with

  damn morally ambivalent to begin with 
   go  

00:17:08.910   00:17:08.920  
  get hammered a lot by what they go
  

00:17:08.920   00:17:10.950  
  get hammered a lot by what they go
through    that  

00:17:10.950   00:17:10.960  
through   that
  

00:17:10.960   00:17:12.420  
through   that
they're     sort     of  

00:17:12.420   00:17:12.430  
they're hammered   of
  

00:17:12.430   00:17:15.270  
they're hammered   of
ethical     the     point  

00:17:15.270   00:17:15.280  
   mid point
  

00:17:15.280   00:17:17.610  
   mid point
of     are     people  

00:17:17.610   00:17:17.620  
of their life's journey   people
  

00:17:17.620   00:17:19.980  
of their life's journey   people
who     can  

00:17:19.980   00:17:19.990  
who are solidly   planted who you can
  

00:17:19.990   00:17:23.300  
who are solidly   planted who you can
trust     or  

00:17:23.300   00:17:23.310  
trust   and who don't betray being or
  

00:17:23.310   00:17:25.800  
trust   and who don't betray being or 
   so  

00:17:25.800   00:17:25.810  
  themselves or their fellow man and so
  

00:17:25.810   00:17:30.120  
  themselves or their fellow man and so
it's     interesting     seems  

00:17:30.120   00:17:30.130  
it's an   I mean it seems
  

00:17:30.130   00:17:33.570

an   association between their own
  

00:22:59.670   00:23:00.740  
an   association between their own

someone else so anyways back to   the coat
of     be  

00:23:35.810   00:23:35.820  
of many   colors well for something to be
  

00:23:35.820   00:23:39.380  
of many   colors well for something to be
many     the     entire  

00:23:39.380   00:23:39.390  
many colored it sort of spans the   entire
  

00:23:39.390   00:23:41.810  
many colored it sort of spans the   entire
gamut    a  

00:23:41.810   00:23:41.820  
gamut   of possibility and so there's a
  

00:23:41.820   00:23:43.690  
gamut   of possibility and so there's a
hint     a  

00:23:43.690   00:23:43.700  
hint there that if you   want to be a

of   you
  

00:24:45.900   00:24:47.240  
of   you
than     less  

00:24:47.240   00:24:47.250  
than you thought and   that there's less
  

00:24:47.250   00:24:50.120  
than you thought and   that there's less
to     then  

00:24:50.120   00:24:50.130  
to the problem than   you thought and then
  

00:24:50.130   00:24:51.590  
to the problem than   you thought and then
you     into  

00:24:51.590   00:24:51.600  
you can decompose it further into
 

00:24:51.600   00:24:53.360  
you can decompose it further into
   figure  

00:24:53.360   00:24:53.370  
   you can figure
  

00:24:53.370   00:24:54.710  
   you can figure
out     smaller  

00:24:54.710   00:24:54.720  
out how to   approach those smaller
  

00:24:54.720   00:24:57.380  
out how to   approach those smaller
problems     doesn't     seem  

00:24:57.380   00:24:57.390  
problems and so and then it   seem
  

00:24:57.390   00:24:59.720  
problems and so and then it   seem
to     frightened  

00:24:59.720   00:24:59.730  
to me to be   that you get less frightened
  

00:24:59.730   00:25:01.040  
to me to be   that you get less frightened
it     be     more  

00:25:01.040   00:25:01.050  
it seems to be   that you get more
  

00:25:01.050   00:25:02.780  
it seems to be   that you get more
courageous     than  

00:25:02.780   00:25:02.790  
courageous   which is way better than
  

00:25:02.790   00:25:04.100  
courageous   which is way better than 
   there's  

00:25:04.100   00:25:04.110  
   because there's
  

00:25:04.110   00:25:05.600  
   because there's
lots     of     so  

00:25:05.600   00:25:05.610  
lots of   about so
  

00:25:05.610   00:25:07.370  
lots of   about so
if     really  

00:25:07.370   00:25:07.380  
if you're   courageous that that really
  

00:25:07.380   00:25:09.560  
if you're   courageous that that really 
   what  

00:25:09.560   00:25:09.570  
   now the question is what
  

00:25:09.570   00:25:12.110  
   now the question is what
happens     that  

00:25:12.110   00:25:12.120  
happens if   you like let's say that
  

00:25:12.120   00:25:15.470  
happens if   you like let's say that
you're    don't  

00:25:15.470   00:25:15.480  
you're   you don't
  

00:25:15.480   00:25:17.000  
you're   you don't
know     yourself     to  

00:25:17.000   00:25:17.010  
know how to introduce yourself   to
  

00:25:17.010   00:25:19.610  
know how to introduce yourself   to
make     of

make any establish the initial   parts of
  

00:25:19.620   00:25:21.590  
make any establish the initial   parts of
a    then  

00:25:21.590   00:25:21.600  
a   anyone and so then
  

00:25:21.600   00:25:23.360  
a   anyone and so then

   and so
then     question     it  

00:25:28.160   00:25:28.170  
then the question   is how is it
  

00:25:28.170   00:25:31.280  
then the question   is how is it
technically    say  

00:25:31.280   00:25:31.290  
technically   that you transform you say
  

00:25:31.290   00:25:33.500  
technically   that you transform you say

  they're pretty damn happy about that
because     actually     paying  

00:27:35.919   00:27:35.929  
because it means   paying
  

00:27:35.929   00:27:37.539  
because it means   paying
attention     and     actually

like     knowledge     a  

00:27:56.950   00:27:56.960  
like really embodied knowledge   it's a
  

00:27:56.960   00:27:59.049  
like really embodied knowledge   it's a
special     memory     you're

special   you're

special   you're 
   new  

00:28:01.330   00:28:01.340  
   that's building new
  

00:28:01.340   00:28:04.749  
   that's building new
skills     for     to  

00:28:04.749   00:28:04.759  
skills for   you and then by listening to
  

00:28:04.759   00:28:06.039  
skills for   you and then by listening to
the     person     yourself  

00:28:06.039   00:28:06.049  
the person   and watching yourself

the person   and watching yourself
interact     new  

00:28:10.299   00:28:10.309  
interact   you're also generating new new
  

00:28:10.309   00:28:12.399  
interact   you're also generating new new

abstract   information that enables you to
  

00:28:12.409   00:28:13.989  
abstract   information that enables you to
conceptualize     different

conceptualize the world in a different

conceptualize the world in a different

00:28:16.779   00:28:16.789  
   so if you go out to ten you go out
  

00:28:16.789   00:28:19.119  
   so if you go out to ten you go out
and     ten     50  

00:28:19.119   00:28:19.129  
and talk to   people or 50
  

00:28:19.129   00:28:21.609  
and talk to   people or 50
different    listen  

00:28:21.609   00:28:21.619  
different   listen
  

00:28:21.619   00:28:23.560  
different   listen
to     get     to  

00:28:23.560   00:28:23.570  
   to
  

00:28:23.570   00:28:25.659  
   to
watch     express  

00:28:25.659   00:28:25.669  
  watch how they're how they express
  

00:28:25.669   00:28:28.239  
  watch how they're how they express
themselves    of  

00:28:28.239   00:28:28.249  
themselves   of
  

00:28:28.249   00:28:29.590  
themselves   of
knowledge     you  

00:28:29.590   00:28:29.600  
knowledge   that changes the way you
  

00:28:29.600   00:28:31.899  
knowledge   that changes the way you
perceive     social  

00:28:31.899   00:28:31.909  
perceive that broadens you as a   social
  

00:28:31.909   00:28:34.240  
perceive that broadens you as a   social
agent     of  

00:28:34.240   00:28:34.250  
agent okay so that's two forms   of
  

00:28:34.250   00:28:35.710  
agent okay so that's two forms   of
knowledge     one  

00:28:35.710   00:28:35.720  
knowledge   but then there's a third one
  

00:28:35.720   00:28:36.320  
knowledge   but then there's a third one
which    real  

00:28:36.320   00:28:36.330  
which   is real
  

00:28:36.330   00:28:38.660  
which   is real
interesting     is     you  

00:28:38.660   00:28:38.670  
interesting which   that you know you
  

00:28:38.670   00:28:41.630  
interesting which   that you know you
have     of     and  

00:28:41.630   00:28:41.640  
have a lot of   and
  

00:28:41.640   00:28:43.730  
have a lot of   and
it's     but  

00:28:43.730   00:28:43.740  
it's hard   to know what potential is but
  

00:28:43.740   00:28:46.040  
it's hard   to know what potential is but
part     is     of  

00:28:46.040   00:28:46.050  
part of it is   that you're capable of
  

00:28:46.050   00:28:49.130  
part of it is   that you're capable of
generating    haven't  

00:28:49.130   00:28:49.140  
generating   proteins that you haven't
  

00:28:49.140   00:28:50.720  
generating   proteins that you haven't
been     right  

00:28:50.720   00:28:50.730  
been generating so you should get right
 

00:28:50.730   00:28:53.480  
been generating so you should get right
on     that    way  

00:28:53.480   00:28:53.490  
on that   by the way so but what the way
  

00:28:53.490   00:28:55.190  
on that   by the way so but what the way
that     put  

00:28:55.190   00:28:55.200  
that works in part is   that if you put
  

00:28:55.200   00:28:57.020  
that works in part is   that if you put 
   situation  

00:28:57.020   00:28:57.030  
   in a radically new situation
  

00:28:57.030   00:29:00.590  
   in a radically new situation 
   genetic  

00:29:00.590   00:29:00.600  
  then your brain that there are genetic
  

00:29:00.600   00:29:02.930  
  then your brain that there are genetic
switches     the  

00:29:02.930   00:29:02.940  
switches   that turn on because of the
  

00:29:02.940   00:29:05.180  
switches   that turn on because of the
demands     new     code  

00:29:05.180   00:29:05.190  
demands of   code
  

00:29:05.190   00:29:08.800  
demands of   code
for     as     have  

00:29:08.800   00:29:08.810  
for new proteins so it's as   if you have
  

00:29:08.810   00:29:11.390  
for new proteins so it's as   if you have
latent     of  

00:29:11.390   00:29:11.400  
latent   software that would be one way of
  

00:29:11.400   00:29:13.490  
latent   software that would be one way of 
   turned  

00:29:13.490   00:29:13.500  
  thinking about that will only be turned
  

00:29:13.500   00:29:15.620  
  thinking about that will only be turned 
   where  

00:29:15.620   00:29:15.630  
   situation where
  

00:29:15.630   00:29:17.750  
   situation where 
   might  

00:29:17.750   00:29:17.760  
   and so then you might
  

00:29:17.760   00:29:20.180  
   and so then you might 
   much  

00:29:20.180   00:29:20.190  
   how much
  

00:29:20.190   00:29:22.070  
   how much
of     be     a  

00:29:22.070   00:29:22.080  
of you could be   on if you went a
  

00:29:22.080   00:29:23.660  
of you could be   on if you went a
whole     different     and  

00:29:23.660   00:29:23.670  
whole bunch of different   places and
  

00:29:23.670   00:29:26.030  
whole bunch of different   places and
that's     really     profound  

00:29:26.030   00:29:26.040  
that's a really really   that's a profound
  

00:29:26.040   00:29:29.480  
that's a really really   that's a profound 
   answers  

00:29:29.480   00:29:29.490  
  question because one of the deep answers
  

00:29:29.490   00:29:32.060  
  question because one of the deep answers
to     should     together  

00:29:32.060   00:29:32.070  
to how you should   get your life together
  

00:29:32.070   00:29:35.240  
to how you should   get your life together 
   of  

00:29:35.240   00:29:35.250  
   should go a very large number of
  

00:29:35.250   00:29:40.010  
   should go a very large number of
places    want  

00:29:40.010   00:29:40.020  
places   and turn yourself on and I want
  

00:29:40.020   00:29:41.180  
places   and turn yourself on and I want
to     walk     bit  

00:29:41.180   00:29:41.190  
to walk   a little bit
  

00:29:41.190   00:29:43.610  
to walk   a little bit
because     symbolic  

00:29:43.610   00:29:43.620  
because there's a very   rich symbolic
  

00:29:43.620   00:29:48.140  
because there's a very   rich symbolic
world     expresses     the

00:32:22.560   00:32:24.290  
which to fix your eyes   and so that's the
thing    and  

00:32:24.290   00:32:24.300  
thing   technically and
  

00:32:24.300   00:32:27.650  
thing   technically and
the     we  

00:32:27.650   00:32:27.660  
the reason you   need that is because we
  

00:32:27.660   00:32:29.510  
the reason you   need that is because we
know     know  

00:32:29.510   00:32:29.520  
know enough about psychology now to know
 

00:32:29.520   00:32:31.280  
know enough about psychology now to know
that   emotion  

00:32:31.280   00:32:31.290  
that   almost all of the positive emotion
  

00:32:31.290   00:32:32.570  
that   almost all of the positive emotion
that    your  

00:32:32.570   00:32:32.580  
that   experience in your
  

00:32:32.580   00:32:35.030  
that   experience in your 
   analgesic  

00:32:35.030   00:32:35.040  
   and positive emotion is analgesic
  

00:32:35.040   00:32:36.950  
   and positive emotion is analgesic
by     actually     pain  

00:32:36.950   00:32:36.960  
by the way right it actually   quells pain
  

00:32:36.960   00:32:38.780  
by the way right it actually   quells pain
so     gets  

00:32:38.780   00:32:38.790  
so it's not just   positive it also gets
  

00:32:38.790   00:32:40.840  
so it's not just   positive it also gets
rid     of     plus  

00:32:40.840   00:32:40.850  
rid   is a big plus
  

00:32:40.850   00:32:42.980  
rid   is a big plus
almost     emotion     that  

00:32:42.980   00:32:42.990  
almost all the positive emotion   that
  

00:32:42.990   00:32:44.750  
almost all the positive emotion   that
you're     to  

00:32:44.750   00:32:44.760  
you're going to feel you're going   to
  

00:32:44.760   00:32:47.420  
you're going to feel you're going   to
feel     because  

00:32:47.420   00:32:47.430  
  feel in relationship to a goal because
  

00:32:47.430   00:32:49.550  
  feel in relationship to a goal because 
   you  

00:32:49.550   00:32:49.560  
   emotion as you
  

00:32:49.560   00:32:51.890  
   emotion as you
approach     to  

00:32:51.890   00:32:51.900  
approach a goal and so if you want to
 

00:32:51.900   00:32:53.510  
approach a goal and so if you want to
   a  

00:32:53.510   00:32:53.520  
  feel positive emotion then you need a
  

00:32:53.520   00:32:55.220  
  feel positive emotion then you need a
goal     then     if  

00:32:55.220   00:32:55.230  
goal and then   if

goal and then   if
you     to     positive  

00:32:57.050   00:32:57.060  
you want   positive
  

00:32:57.060   00:32:59.300  
you want   positive
emotion     also  

00:32:59.300   00:32:59.310  
emotion which is enthusiasm   and also

00:35:31.670   00:35:31.680  
very   interesting I think Solzhenitsyn
  

00:35:31.680   00:35:33.830  
very   interesting I think Solzhenitsyn
said     only

in   of all
  

00:35:36.890   00:35:40.400  
in   of all
that's    I  

00:35:40.400   00:35:40.410  
that's   I
  

00:35:40.410   00:35:43.849  
that's   I
would     the  

00:35:43.849   00:35:43.859  
would   say and so what happens in the

would   say and so what happens in the 
   I  

00:35:46.040   00:35:46.050  
   that because and I
  

00:35:46.050   00:35:48.349  
   that because and I 
   representative  

00:35:48.349   00:35:48.359  
  think this is a symbolic representative
  

00:35:48.359   00:35:49.880  
  think this is a symbolic representative
of     just     that  

00:35:49.880   00:35:49.890  
of what I just   described you that
  

00:35:49.890   00:35:51.680  
of what I just   described you that
happens     genetic     put  

00:35:51.680   00:35:51.690  
happens at a   level if you put
  

00:35:51.690   00:35:55.280  
happens at a   level if you put
yourself     situations     Geppetto  

00:35:55.280   00:35:55.290  
yourself   so Geppetto

that doesn't   come to terms with such as

that doesn't   come to terms with such as

00:37:05.480   00:37:05.490  
autonomous   beings with freewill and that
  

00:37:05.490   00:37:07.160  
autonomous   beings with freewill and that
that     work     stop  

00:37:07.160   00:37:07.170  
that seems to   if we stop
  

00:37:07.170   00:37:08.750  
that seems to   if we stop 
   very  

00:37:08.750   00:37:08.760  
  doing that then things go to hell very
  

00:37:08.760   00:37:11.720  
  doing that then things go to hell very
very     rapidly     that  

00:37:11.720   00:37:11.730  
very rapidly   so and the mere fact that
  

00:37:11.730   00:37:13.760  
very rapidly   so and the mere fact that
we     what  

00:37:13.760   00:37:13.770  
we have been able   to conceptualize what
  

00:37:13.770   00:37:16.450  
we have been able   to conceptualize what
that     be  

00:37:16.450   00:37:16.460  
that conscious freewill might be
 

00:37:16.460   00:37:18.260  
that conscious freewill might be
metaphysically     doesn't 

00:37:18.260   00:37:18.270  
metaphysically or physically doesn't
 

00:37:18.270   00:37:20.030  
metaphysically or physically doesn't
   that  

00:37:20.030   00:37:20.040  
   exist it just means that
  

00:37:20.040   00:37:22.849  
   exist it just means that 
   it  

00:37:22.849   00:37:22.859  
   I mean what it
  

00:37:22.859   00:37:24.500  
   I mean what it
was    we  

00:37:24.500   00:37:24.510  
was   only in the last 15 years that we
  

00:37:24.510   00:37:26.330  
was   only in the last 15 years that we
discovered     that     the  

00:37:26.330   00:37:26.340  
discovered that   of the
  

00:37:26.340   00:37:27.920  
discovered that   of the 
   of  

00:37:27.920   00:37:27.930  
   of
  

00:37:27.930   00:37:30.260  
   of
matter     that     even  

00:37:30.260   00:37:30.270  
matter that   even
  

00:37:30.270   00:37:32.320  
matter that   even
whose     imagine  

00:37:32.320   00:37:32.330  
whose properties we can't even   imagine
  

00:37:32.330   00:37:36.250  
whose properties we can't even   imagine
except     mass     so  

00:37:36.250   00:37:36.260  
   so
  

00:37:36.260   00:37:38.540  
   so
anyways     Geppetto  

00:37:38.540   00:37:38.550  
anyways what happens is when Geppetto
 

00:37:38.550   00:37:42.470  
anyways what happens is when Geppetto
   he  

00:37:42.470   00:37:42.480  
   the star he
  

00:37:42.480   00:37:45.530  
   the star he
so    the  

00:37:45.530   00:37:45.540  
so   it's society aligning itself with the
  

00:37:45.540   00:37:48.020  
so   it's society aligning itself with the
proper     individual  

00:37:48.020   00:37:48.030  
proper goal   with regards to individual
  

00:37:48.030   00:37:51.380  
proper goal   with regards to individual
development     of  

00:37:51.380   00:37:51.390  
development   right so so the instead of
  

00:37:51.390   00:37:52.850  
development   right so so the instead of
society     the  

00:37:52.850   00:37:52.860  
society being   at odds with the
  

00:37:52.860   00:37:54.770  
society being   at odds with the
individual     what  

00:37:54.770   00:37:54.780  
individual they line up   and then what
  

00:37:54.780   00:37:56.780  
individual they line up   and then what
happens     comes     and  

00:37:56.780   00:37:56.790  
happens is nature comes   onboard and
  

00:37:56.790   00:37:58.609  
happens is nature comes   onboard and 
   the  

00:37:58.609   00:37:58.619  
   blue fairy in the in the
  

00:37:58.619   00:38:00.620  
   blue fairy in the in the
Pinocchio     seems     to  

00:38:00.620   00:38:00.630  
Pinocchio story and that seems   to me to
  

00:38:00.630   00:38:02.450  
Pinocchio story and that seems   to me to 
   what  

00:38:02.450   00:38:02.460  
   symbolic representation of what
  

00:38:02.460   00:38:05.810  
   symbolic representation of what
happens     set  

00:38:05.810   00:38:05.820  
happens biologically when when you set
 

00:38:05.820   00:38:08.180  
happens biologically when when you set
the     properly    culture  

00:38:08.180   00:38:08.190  
the goal properly   get your culture
  

00:38:08.190   00:38:09.590  
the goal properly   get your culture 
   it's  

00:38:09.590   00:38:09.600  
   the world it's
  

00:38:09.600   00:38:12.830  
   the world it's 
   transformation  

00:38:12.830   00:38:12.840  
  that there's a biological transformation
  

00:38:12.840   00:38:14.240  
  that there's a biological transformation
that     that  

00:38:14.240   00:38:14.250  
that   occurs as a consequence of that
  

00:38:14.250   00:38:15.740  
that   occurs as a consequence of that
which     that  

00:38:15.740   00:38:15.750  
which means   that a bunch of you that
  

00:38:15.750   00:38:19.460  
which means   that a bunch of you that
hasn't    I  

00:38:19.460   00:38:19.470  
hasn't   been turned on turns on and I
  

00:38:19.470   00:38:21.590  
hasn't   been turned on turns on and I
guess     one     what  

00:38:21.590   00:38:21.600  
guess   question would be is what
  

00:38:21.600   00:38:23.090  
guess   question would be is what 
   on  

00:38:23.090   00:38:23.100  
  would you be like if you turned on
  

00:38:23.100   00:38:24.800  
  would you be like if you turned on
everything     inside     be  

00:38:24.800   00:38:24.810  
   of you that could be
  

00:38:24.810   00:38:27.740  
   of you that could be
turned    that's  

00:38:27.740   00:38:27.750  
turned   that's
  

00:38:27.750   00:38:33.320  
turned   that's

now     metaphysical

now it sounds of like a metaphysical
 

00:39:04.320   00:39:07.760  
now it sounds of like a metaphysical
idea     even    but

  something like well you're set up so
that     in

that   you're automatically interested in
those     that     you  

00:39:19.550   00:39:19.560  
those things   was fully expand you
  

00:39:19.560   00:39:22.210  
those things   was fully expand you
as     creature     like

fundamentally flawed about you that is
 

00:39:31.470   00:39:33.680  
fundamentally flawed about you that is
what     the    it's  

00:39:33.680   00:39:33.690  
what the   would be it's
  

00:39:33.690   00:39:35.060  
what the   would be it's
kind     think     how  

00:39:35.060   00:39:35.070  
kind   how
  

00:39:35.070   00:39:36.980  
kind   how
that     would     moment

that would   moment to moment

   your

00:39:40.970   00:39:40.980  
interest is captured   things
  

00:39:40.980   00:39:43.040  
interest is captured   things
that     down     of

that   the path of

that   the path of
development 

00:39:44.120   00:39:44.130  
development
 

00:39:44.130   00:39:46.190  
development
well     the    so  

00:39:46.190   00:39:46.200  
well that better be the   okay so
  

00:39:46.200   00:39:48.230  
well that better be the   okay so
that's     utility  

00:39:48.230   00:39:48.240  
that's fine and so there's some utility
 

00:39:48.240   00:39:50.090  
that's fine and so there's some utility
   you're  

00:39:50.090   00:39:50.100  
   those things that you're

   those things that you're

00:39:56.520   00:39:57.860  
   places
now     call     to  

00:39:57.860   00:39:57.870  
now the problem with the call   to
  

00:39:57.870   00:39:59.330  
now the problem with the call   to 
   you  

00:39:59.330   00:39:59.340  
   you

interesting   despite the fact
  

00:40:56.280   00:40:57.560  
interesting   despite the fact 
   still  

00:40:57.560   00:40:57.570  
  that they're fools they're still
  

00:40:57.570   00:41:00.020

they're capable of learning   enough as a
  

00:41:02.220   00:41:03.890  
they're capable of learning   enough as a
consequence     moving     the

consequence of moving   forward on the
  

00:41:03.900   00:41:05.480  
consequence of moving   forward on the
adventure    straighten  

00:41:05.480   00:41:05.490  
adventure   so that they straighten
  

00:41:05.490   00:41:08.180  
adventure   so that they straighten
themselves     time     it's  

00:41:08.180   00:41:08.190  
themselves out across time   and so it's
  

00:41:08.190   00:41:09.220  
themselves out across time   and so it's 
   this  

00:41:09.220   00:41:09.230  
  something like this so this
  

00:41:09.230   00:41:11.150  
  something like this so this
circumambulation     about  

00:41:11.150   00:41:11.160  
circumambulation that   young talked about
  

00:41:11.160   00:41:14.180  
circumambulation that   young talked about
was     this  

00:41:14.180   00:41:14.190  
was this continual will return to this
 

00:41:14.190   00:41:16.700  
was this continual will return to this
this     of 

00:41:16.700   00:41:16.710  
this continual circling in some sense of
 

00:41:16.710   00:41:19.160  
this continual circling in some sense of
who     be    for  

00:41:19.160   00:41:19.170  
who you could be   you might notice for
  

00:41:19.170   00:41:20.570  
who you could be   you might notice for 
   your  

00:41:20.570   00:41:20.580  
   that there are themes in your
  

00:41:20.580   00:41:22.070  
   that there are themes in your 
   across  

00:41:22.070   00:41:22.080  
  life you know when you go back across
  

00:41:22.080   00:41:24.350  
  life you know when you go back across 
   of  

00:41:24.350   00:41:24.360  
   of
  

00:41:24.360   00:41:26.000  
   of
have     typical     sort  

00:41:26.000   00:41:26.010  
have your   experience that sort
  

00:41:26.010   00:41:28.490  
have your   experience that sort 
   be  

00:41:28.490   00:41:28.500  
   and there might be
  

00:41:28.500   00:41:30.920  
   and there might be
variation     on     but  

00:41:30.920   00:41:30.930  
variation on   it like a musical theme but
  

00:41:30.930   00:41:33.710  
variation on   it like a musical theme but
it's     it's     yourself  

00:41:33.710   00:41:33.720  
it's it's   like you're circling yourself
  

00:41:33.720   00:41:35.810  
it's it's   like you're circling yourself
and     to     you  

00:41:35.810   00:41:35.820  
and getting closer to   yourself as you
  

00:41:35.820   00:41:37.040  
and getting closer to   yourself as you
move    time  

00:41:37.040   00:41:37.050  
move   across time
  

00:41:37.050   00:41:39.050  
move   across time
that's     you  

00:41:39.050   00:41:39.060  
that's the circumambulation now you
 

00:41:39.060   00:41:40.370  
that's the circumambulation now you
remember   go  

00:41:40.370   00:41:40.380  
remember   well go
  

00:41:40.380   00:41:42.080  
remember   well go 
   that  

00:41:42.080   00:41:42.090  
   so imagine that
  

00:41:42.090   00:41:44.360  
   so imagine that 
   an  

00:41:44.360   00:41:44.370  
  something glimmers before you it's an
  

00:41:44.370   00:41:47.060  
  something glimmers before you it's an 
   decide  

00:41:47.060   00:41:47.070  
  interest that's dawning and you decide
  

00:41:47.070   00:41:49.010  
  interest that's dawning and you decide
well     paralyzed     you  

00:41:49.010   00:41:49.020  
well first of all   you
  

00:41:49.020   00:41:50.300  
well first of all   you 
   should  

00:41:50.300   00:41:50.310  
  think well how do I know if I should
  

00:41:50.310   00:41:52.220  
  think well how do I know if I should
pursue     stupid     idea  

00:41:52.220   00:41:52.230  
pursue   idea
  

00:41:52.230   00:41:54.560  
pursue   idea 
   is  

00:41:54.560   00:41:54.570  
   to that is
  

00:41:54.570   00:41:56.270  
   to that is 
   stupid  

00:41:56.270   00:41:56.280  
   probably is a stupid
  

00:41:56.280   00:41:57.829  
   probably is a stupid 
   all  

00:41:57.829   00:41:57.839  
   because almost all
  

00:41:57.839   00:42:00.680  
   because almost all
all     ideas     the  

00:42:00.680   00:42:00.690  
all ideas   and so the
  

00:42:00.690   00:42:03.349  
all ideas   and so the 
   on  

00:42:03.349   00:42:03.359  
   that as you move forward on
  

00:42:03.359   00:42:04.819  
   that as you move forward on 
   it  

00:42:04.819   00:42:04.829  
  your adventure that you're gonna get it
  

00:42:04.829   00:42:07.849  
  your adventure that you're gonna get it 
   just  

00:42:07.849   00:42:07.859  
   is zero it's just
  

00:42:07.859   00:42:08.749  
   is zero it's just
not     happen  

00:42:08.749   00:42:08.759  
not gonna happen
 

00:42:08.759   00:42:10.819  
not gonna happen
and     might    maybe  

00:42:10.819   00:42:10.829  
and so then you might   well maybe
  

00:42:10.829   00:42:12.920  
and so then you might   well maybe
I'll     the  

00:42:12.920   00:42:12.930  
I'll   just wait around until I get the
  

00:42:12.930   00:42:13.579  
I'll   just wait around until I get the 
   idea  

00:42:13.579   00:42:13.589  
  right idea
  

00:42:13.589   00:42:15.799  
  right idea 
   they're  

00:42:15.799   00:42:15.809  
   right so they're
  

00:42:15.809   00:42:17.749  
   right so they're
like     year     olds  

00:42:17.749   00:42:17.759  
like 40   thirteen year olds
  

00:42:17.759   00:42:20.089  
like 40   thirteen year olds
which     wait  

00:42:20.089   00:42:20.099  
which is not a good   idea so they wait
  

00:42:20.099   00:42:22.099  
which is not a good   idea so they wait
around     Waiting     Godot  

00:42:22.099   00:42:22.109  
around   Godot
  

00:42:22.109   00:42:24.650  
around   Godot
until     they     the  

00:42:24.650   00:42:24.660  
   but the
  

00:42:24.660   00:42:26.059

problem   know
  

00:42:26.069   00:42:27.920  
problem   know
when     got     waiting

had   data
  

00:42:49.739   00:42:52.160  
had   data
will     will     really

will will   stupidity which I really
  

00:42:52.170   00:42:54.559  
will will   stupidity which I really
liked     stupidity  

00:42:54.559   00:42:54.569  
liked   so because he thought of stupidity
  

00:42:54.569   00:42:57.769

   have  

00:42:57.769   00:42:57.779  
   it's you have
  

00:42:57.779   00:42:59.959  
   it's you have 
   fundamentally  

00:42:59.959   00:42:59.969  
   fundamentally
  

00:42:59.969   00:43:02.839  
   fundamentally
and     and     can  

00:43:02.839   00:43:02.849  
and work with it and   so you can
  

00:43:02.849   00:43:05.440  
and work with it and   so you can
take    your  

00:43:05.440   00:43:05.450  
take   these tentative steps on your
  

00:43:05.450   00:43:08.539  
take   these tentative steps on your
pathway     assume  

00:43:08.539   00:43:08.549  
pathway to destiny   and you can assume
  

00:43:08.549   00:43:10.519  
pathway to destiny   and you can assume 
   that's  

00:43:10.519   00:43:10.529  
   and that's
  

00:43:10.529   00:43:12.469  
   and that's
really     to  

00:43:12.469   00:43:12.479  
really   useful because you don't have to
  

00:43:12.479   00:43:13.969  
really   useful because you don't have to
beat     to     do  

00:43:13.969   00:43:13.979  
beat yourself   do
  

00:43:13.979   00:43:16.279

better    it  

00:43:18.019   00:43:18.029  
better   to do it badly than not to do it

00:43:43.950   00:43:46.370  
away   at home and that's the that's great
so     well  

00:43:46.370   00:43:46.380  
so   that's good and so why is that well
  

00:43:46.380   00:43:48.440  
so   that's good and so why is that well 
   you  

00:43:48.440   00:43:48.450  
  okay so you you start your path and you
  

00:43:48.450   00:43:49.969  
  okay so you you start your path and you
think     know  

00:43:49.969   00:43:49.979  
think that   you're heading you know
  

00:43:49.979   00:43:52.849  
think that   you're heading you know
towards     that  

00:43:52.849   00:43:52.859  
towards your star   and so you go in that
  

00:43:52.859   00:43:56.809  
towards your star   and so you go in that
direction     here  

00:43:56.809   00:43:56.819  
direction   and then because you're here
  

00:43:56.819   00:43:58.489  
direction   and then because you're here
the     but  

00:43:58.489   00:43:58.499  
the world looks a particular way but
 

00:43:58.499   00:44:01.579  
the world looks a particular way but
   looks  

00:44:01.579   00:44:01.589  
  then when you move here the world looks
  

00:44:01.589   00:44:03.380  
  then when you move here the world looks 
   a  

00:44:03.380   00:44:03.390  
  different and you're different as a
  

00:44:03.390   00:44:05.180  
  different and you're different as a
consequence    voyage  

00:44:05.180   00:44:05.190  
consequence   of having made that voyage
  

00:44:05.190   00:44:07.519  
consequence   of having made that voyage
and     what     that  

00:44:07.519   00:44:07.529  
and so what   that
  

00:44:07.529   00:44:09.349  
and so what   that
thing     is  

00:44:09.349   00:44:09.359  
thing that glimmers   in front of you is
  

00:44:09.359   00:44:10.970

at     begin     now  

00:44:15.500   00:44:15.510  
at specifying it to begin   with and now
  

00:44:15.510   00:44:16.990  
at specifying it to begin   with and now
that     little     more  

00:44:16.990   00:44:17.000  
that you're a little   sharper and more

that you're a little   sharper and more

   you know

   you know
it's     but  

00:44:30.349   00:44:30.359  
it's almost like 180 degree reversal   but
  

00:44:30.359   00:44:32.599  
it's almost like 180 degree reversal   but
it     you've  

00:44:32.599   00:44:32.609  
  it isn't because you know you've
  

00:44:32.609   00:44:36.560  
  it isn't because you know you've
I     this     a  

00:44:36.560   00:44:36.570  
I mean you've gone this   and that's a
  

00:44:36.570   00:44:40.160  
I mean you've gone this   and that's a
long     a  

00:44:40.160   00:44:40.170  
long ways to   get that far but that's a
  

00:44:40.170   00:44:43.160  
long ways to   get that far but that's a
lot     you  

00:44:43.160   00:44:43.170  
lot farther than you would be if you
 

00:44:43.170   00:44:45.010  
lot farther than you would be if you
   and  

00:44:45.010   00:44:45.020  
   were waiting and
  

00:44:45.020   00:44:48.790  
   were waiting and
so     overshoot  

00:44:48.790   00:44:48.800  
so it doesn't   matter that you overshoot
  

00:44:48.800   00:44:52.690  
so it doesn't   matter that you overshoot
continually     overshoot  

00:44:52.690   00:44:52.700  
continually because   as you overshoot
  

00:44:52.700   00:44:55.400  
continually because   as you overshoot 
   should  

00:44:55.400   00:44:55.410  
  even if you don't learn what you should
  

00:44:55.410   00:44:56.840  
  even if you don't learn what you should 
   continually  

00:44:56.840   00:44:56.850  
  have done you're going to continually
  

00:44:56.850   00:44:59.650  
  have done you're going to continually 
   and  

00:44:59.650   00:44:59.660  
  learn what you shouldn't keep doing and
  

00:44:59.660   00:45:02.330  
  learn what you shouldn't keep doing and
if     you  

00:45:02.330   00:45:02.340  
if   you learn enough about what you
  

00:45:02.340   00:45:04.640  
if   you learn enough about what you
shouldn't     that's  

00:45:04.640   00:45:04.650  
shouldn't keep doing then that's
 

00:45:04.650   00:45:06.890  
shouldn't keep doing then that's
tantamount   at  

00:45:06.890   00:45:06.900  
tantamount   at some point to learning at
  

00:45:06.900   00:45:08.290  
tantamount   at some point to learning at
the     doing  

00:45:08.290   00:45:08.300  
the same   time what you should be doing
  

00:45:08.300   00:45:14.300  
the same   time what you should be doing 
   now  

00:45:14.300   00:45:14.310  
  so it's okay so it's like this now
  

00:45:14.310   00:45:16.010  
  so it's okay so it's like this now

that   of

00:45:22.010   00:45:22.020  
overshooting starts to decline   and

overshooting starts to decline   and
that     nothing

00:48:29.300   00:48:29.310  
complete bloody catastrophe it's worse
 

00:48:29.310   00:48:31.700  
complete bloody catastrophe it's worse
and     can    yourself  

00:48:31.700   00:48:31.710  
and then maybe you can   yourself
  

00:48:31.710   00:48:34.310  
and then maybe you can   yourself
together     and  

00:48:34.310   00:48:34.320  
together   and you hit a new plateau and
  

00:48:34.320   00:48:36.230  
together   and you hit a new plateau and
then     crumbles     bang  

00:48:36.230   00:48:36.240  
then that crumbles   and shakes and bang
  

00:48:36.240   00:48:38.540  
then that crumbles   and shakes and bang
it's     so  

00:48:38.540   00:48:38.550  
it's worse   again and so
  

00:48:38.550   00:48:39.680  
it's worse   again and so
because     the     people

so anyways   the fact that you're full of
faults    and

faults   mean you have to stop and
thank     for     really

useful     thing     you're  

00:49:48.320   00:49:48.330  
useful thing   and the fact that you're
  

00:49:48.330   00:49:50.120  
useful thing   and the fact that you're
full     you  

00:49:50.120   00:49:50.130  
full of   faults doesn't mean that you
  

00:49:50.130   00:49:52.970  
full of   faults doesn't mean that you
can't     pause     an  

00:49:52.970   00:49:52.980  
can't learn and so you can pause   it an
  

00:49:52.980   00:49:55.220  
can't learn and so you can pause   it an
ideal     wrong     it  

00:49:55.220   00:49:55.230  
ideal and you're gonna be wrong   about it
  

00:49:55.230   00:49:56.840  
ideal and you're gonna be wrong   about it 
   what  

00:49:56.840   00:49:56.850  
  but it doesn't matter because what
  

00:49:56.850   00:49:58.670  
  but it doesn't matter because what
you're     positing     ideal  

00:49:58.670   00:49:58.680  
you're right about   the ideal
  

00:49:58.680   00:50:01.190  
you're right about   the ideal
moving    ideal  

00:50:01.190   00:50:01.200  
moving   towards it if the actual ideal
  

00:50:01.200   00:50:05.750  
moving   towards it if the actual ideal
isn't     first  

00:50:05.750   00:50:05.760  
isn't conceptualize perfectly well first

on the left there that's the   short 
   the  

00:51:45.650   00:51:45.660  
  Cathedral that's the one that has the
  

00:51:45.660   00:51:48.319  
  Cathedral that's the one that has the 
   they  

00:51:48.319   00:51:48.329  
   you about they
  

00:51:48.329   00:51:50.329  
   you about they
actually    now  

00:51:50.329   00:51:50.339  
actually   light that up with lasers now
  

00:51:50.339   00:51:53.420  
actually   light that up with lasers now 
   and  

00:51:53.420   00:51:53.430  
  and so that's it lit up with lasers and
  

00:51:53.430   00:51:55.849  
  and so that's it lit up with lasers and
so     turning     a  

00:51:55.849   00:51:55.859  
so so they're turning   it into a
  

00:51:55.859   00:51:57.770  
so so they're turning   it into a 
   is  

00:51:57.770   00:51:57.780  
   which i think is
  

00:51:57.780   00:51:59.960  
   which i think is
really     a  

00:51:59.960   00:51:59.970  
really   fascinating and it's a it's a
  

00:51:59.970   00:52:01.700  
really   fascinating and it's a it's a
continuation     right  

00:52:01.700   00:52:01.710  
continuation of the same   idea right
  

00:52:01.710   00:52:03.440  
continuation of the same   idea right 
   were  

00:52:03.440   00:52:03.450  
   glass windows were
  

00:52:03.450   00:52:05.660  
   glass windows were 
   primitive  

00:52:05.660   00:52:05.670  
  obviously I wouldn't call them primitive
  

00:52:05.670   00:52:07.490  
  obviously I wouldn't call them primitive
attempts     glass  

00:52:07.490   00:52:07.500  
attempts to do   that I mean stained glass
  

00:52:07.500   00:52:09.410  
attempts to do   that I mean stained glass
windows     impressive     know  

00:52:09.410   00:52:09.420  
windows are pretty   you know
  

00:52:09.420   00:52:11.750  
windows are pretty   you know 
   same  

00:52:11.750   00:52:11.760  
  buddy it's an elaboration of the same
  

00:52:11.760   00:52:13.069  
  buddy it's an elaboration of the same
thing     so     that  

00:52:13.069   00:52:13.079  
thing so   that
  

00:52:13.079   00:52:14.630  
thing so   that
Cathedral     town  

00:52:14.630   00:52:14.640  
Cathedral they light up   the whole town
  

00:52:14.640   00:52:16.940  
Cathedral they light up   the whole town
like     something     and  

00:52:16.940   00:52:16.950  
like that which   and
  

00:52:16.950   00:52:18.620  
like that which   and
so    cathedral  

00:52:18.620   00:52:18.630  
so   cathedral
  

00:52:18.630   00:52:21.890

there's     doubt     you

bitter resentful   all that does
is     worse     accept  

00:53:11.030   00:53:11.040  
is make it   have to accept
  

00:53:11.040   00:53:13.340  
is make it   have to accept 
   because  

00:53:13.340   00:53:13.350  
   now that's not an easy thing because
  

00:53:13.350   00:53:14.810  
   now that's not an easy thing because 
   heroic  

00:53:14.810   00:53:14.820  
   actually I would say a heroic
  

00:53:14.820   00:53:16.910  
   actually I would say a heroic 
   the  

00:53:16.910   00:53:16.920  
  task to voluntarily accept the
  

00:53:16.920   00:53:18.500  
  task to voluntarily accept the
conditions     own     and  

00:53:18.500   00:53:18.510  
conditions of   existence and
  

00:53:18.510   00:53:21.200  
conditions of   existence and 
   that's  

00:53:21.200   00:53:21.210  
  that happens out the cross so that's
  

00:53:21.210   00:53:23.270  
  that happens out the cross so that's
fine     light  

00:53:23.270   00:53:23.280  
fine   and that's associated with light
  

00:53:23.280   00:53:25.790  
fine   and that's associated with light 
   associated  

00:53:25.790   00:53:25.800  
   that's associated
  

00:53:25.800   00:53:26.960  
   that's associated
with     you     be  

00:53:26.960   00:53:26.970  
   to be
  

00:53:26.970   00:53:28.790  
   to be
associated    a  

00:53:28.790   00:53:28.800  
associated   with darkness that would be a
  

00:53:28.800   00:53:37.520  
associated   with darkness that would be a
bad     thing     there's  

00:53:37.520   00:53:37.530  
bad thing   so and so there's the there's
  

00:53:37.530   00:53:43.940  
bad thing   so and so there's the there's
the     that     1280  

00:53:43.940   00:53:43.950  
the the labyrinth that   was built in 1280
  

00:53:43.950   00:53:47.150  
the the labyrinth that   was built in 1280
and     in     it's  

00:53:47.150   00:53:47.160  
and   here it's
  

00:53:47.160   00:53:50.050  
and   here it's
the     idea     of  

00:53:50.050   00:53:50.060  
the same idea   star sequence of
  

00:53:50.060   00:53:52.550  
the same idea   star sequence of
slides     here's  

00:53:52.550   00:53:52.560  
slides   that I just showed you so here's
  

00:53:52.560   00:53:56.530  
slides   that I just showed you so here's
the     west     east  

00:53:56.530   00:53:56.540  
the   and east
  

00:53:56.540   00:53:59.000  
the   and east 
   in  

00:53:59.000   00:53:59.010  
  so that's the whole world laid out in
  

00:53:59.010   00:54:01.400  
  so that's the whole world laid out in
two     is  

00:54:01.400   00:54:01.410  
two dimensions and so the question is
 

00:54:01.410   00:54:02.840  
two dimensions and so the question is
how     you    we  

00:54:02.840   00:54:02.850  
how do you   we
  

00:54:02.850   00:54:03.950  
how do you   we
already     is     the  

00:54:03.950   00:54:03.960  
already   the
  

00:54:03.960   00:54:06.140  
already   the 
   that's  

00:54:06.140   00:54:06.150  
   that's
  

00:54:06.150   00:54:08.150  
   that's
the     could  

00:54:08.150   00:54:08.160  
  the place of maximal suffering you could
  

00:54:08.160   00:54:11.390  
  the place of maximal suffering you could
say     it's  

00:54:11.390   00:54:11.400  
say maximal malevolence as well   but it's
  

00:54:11.400   00:54:13.070  
say maximal malevolence as well   but it's
also     place     transcendent  

00:54:13.070   00:54:13.080  
also the place   where that's transcendent
  

00:54:13.080   00:54:15.590  
also the place   where that's transcendent 
   answer  

00:54:15.590   00:54:15.600  
   well the answer
  

00:54:15.600   00:54:17.270  
   well the answer
is     the  

00:54:17.270   00:54:17.280  
is   well you don't just stand on the
  

00:54:17.280   00:54:19.880  
is   well you don't just stand on the
outside     in  

00:54:19.880   00:54:19.890  
outside looking in
 

00:54:19.890   00:54:22.820  
outside looking in
that's     help    can't  

00:54:22.820   00:54:22.830  
that's not gonna help   so and you can't
  

00:54:22.830   00:54:25.220  
that's not gonna help   so and you can't
just     center     if  

00:54:25.220   00:54:25.230  
just run right to   even if
  

00:54:25.230   00:54:30.770  
just run right to   even if
you're     and     to  

00:54:30.770   00:54:30.780  
you're in California   so you have to
  

00:54:30.780   00:54:33.800  
you're in California   so you have to
walk     go  

00:54:33.800   00:54:33.810  
walk in here   and then you see you go
  

00:54:33.810   00:54:37.580  
walk in here   and then you see you go 
   single  

00:54:37.580   00:54:37.590  
   single
  

00:54:37.590   00:54:41.570  
   single
place     place     that  

00:54:41.570   00:54:41.580  
   on that on that
  

00:54:41.580   00:54:44.090  
   on that on that
little     cosmos     gone  

00:54:44.090   00:54:44.100  
little cosmos   and then once you've gone
  

00:54:44.100   00:54:46.040  
little cosmos   and then once you've gone
to    expanded  

00:54:46.040   00:54:46.050  
to   place and expanded
  

00:54:46.050   00:54:47.930  
to   place and expanded
yourself     north  

00:54:47.930   00:54:47.940  
yourself as a consequence of going   north
  

00:54:47.940   00:54:50.750  
yourself as a consequence of going   north
and     there's  

00:54:50.750   00:54:50.760  
and west and   east and south then there's
  

00:54:50.760   00:54:52.730  
and west and   east and south then there's
enough     so     that  

00:54:52.730   00:54:52.740  
enough of you so that you're at so   that
  

00:54:52.740   00:54:54.770  
enough of you so that you're at so   that
you     first     that  

00:54:54.770   00:54:54.780  
you can tolerate being first   of all that
  

00:54:54.780   00:54:55.910  
you can tolerate being first   of all that
you    is  

00:54:55.910   00:54:55.920  
you   out where the center is
  

00:54:55.920   00:54:57.920  
you   out where the center is
but     at  

00:54:57.920   00:54:57.930  
but also that you can tolerate being   at
  

00:54:57.930   00:54:59.990  
but also that you can tolerate being   at
the     that  

00:54:59.990   00:55:00.000  
the center and so that's what that
 

00:55:00.000   00:55:03.109  
the center and so that's what that
   mean  

00:55:03.109   00:55:03.119  
  represents that's pretty and look I mean
  

00:55:03.119   00:55:05.060  
  represents that's pretty and look I mean

   and there are
things    way  

01:05:57.240   01:05:57.250

   into a dinner party
  

01:05:58.750   01:06:00.810  
   into a dinner party
there     you  

01:06:00.810   01:06:00.820  
there are things happening   there you
  

01:06:00.820   01:06:03.300  
there are things happening   there you
know     something  

01:06:03.300   01:06:03.310  
know it's not the dream isn't something
 

01:06:03.310   01:06:05.310  
know it's not the dream isn't something
that's     subject    for  

01:06:05.310   01:06:05.320  
that's subject   capacity for
  

01:06:05.320   01:06:07.020  
that's subject   capacity for

01:06:07.030   01:06:09.660  
manipulation   it's something that happens 
   so  

01:06:09.660   01:06:09.670  
   you do and so
  

01:06:09.670   01:06:11.790  
   you do and so

you've got   three options you can just
  

01:06:13.720   01:06:16.620  
you've got   three options you can just
discount     dreams     what  

01:06:16.620   01:06:16.630  
discount dreams   altogether which is what

   at  

01:08:05.370   01:08:05.380

perhaps even the   fact that he might be
someone     something

someone destined for for something
 

01:08:14.590   01:08:16.829  
someone destined for for something
   perfectly  

01:08:16.829   01:08:16.839  
   they find it perfectly
  

01:08:16.839   01:08:20.130  
   they find it perfectly
reasonable     so  

01:08:20.130   01:08:20.140  
reasonable to destroy that   and it's so
  

01:08:20.140   01:08:24.030  
reasonable to destroy that   and it's so
hard     motif  

01:08:24.030   01:08:24.040  
hard so interesting how often that motif
 

01:08:24.040   01:08:26.760  
hard so interesting how often that motif
   manifests  

01:08:26.760   01:08:26.770  
  of pulling down an ideal manifests
  

01:08:26.770   01:08:28.950  
  of pulling down an ideal manifests
itself     right     it's  

01:08:28.950   01:08:28.960  
itself in these old   it's
  

01:08:28.960   01:08:31.019  
itself in these old   it's
it's     the  

01:08:31.019   01:08:31.029  
it's the pattern   is established in the
  

01:08:31.029   01:08:32.760  
it's the pattern   is established in the
Cain     repeats     and  

01:08:32.760   01:08:32.770  
Cain and Abel story it   and
  

01:08:32.770   01:08:34.590  
Cain and Abel story it   and
repeats     that's  

01:08:34.590   01:08:34.600  
repeats and repeats and I   think that's
  

01:08:34.600   01:08:36.269  
repeats and repeats and I   think that's
dead     just     all  

01:08:36.269   01:08:36.279  
dead true I   repeats all
  

01:08:36.279   01:08:38.640  
dead true I   repeats all
the     annoyed  

01:08:38.640   01:08:38.650  
the time so that   people are annoyed
  

01:08:38.650   01:08:41.099  
the time so that   people are annoyed
about    are  

01:08:41.099   01:08:41.109  
about   how tragic their lives are
  

01:08:41.109   01:08:42.930  
about   how tragic their lives are
annoyed     to  

01:08:42.930   01:08:42.940  
annoyed that   they're subject to
  

01:08:42.940   01:08:44.669  
annoyed that   they're subject to
malevolence     that  

01:08:44.669   01:08:44.679  
malevolence   and they're annoyed that
  

01:08:44.679   01:08:46.620  
malevolence   and they're annoyed that 
   other  

01:08:46.620   01:08:46.630  
   well as other
  

01:08:46.630   01:08:49.079  
   well as other 
   them  

01:08:49.079   01:08:49.089  
   and that makes them
  

01:08:49.089   01:08:50.939

01:18:16.470   01:18:19.430  
well   but I don't think it is I mean I've
got     last  

01:18:19.430   01:18:19.440  
got thousands   of letters now in the last
  

01:18:19.440   01:18:22.640  
got thousands   of letters now in the last
year    that  

01:18:22.640   01:18:22.650  
year   who have told me that
  

01:18:22.650   01:18:26.270  
year   who have told me that 
   right  

01:18:26.270   01:18:26.280  
  they were in a pit that's exactly right
  

01:18:26.280   01:18:28.910  
  they were in a pit that's exactly right 
   were  

01:18:28.910   01:18:28.920  
  and that they decided that they were
  

01:18:28.920   01:18:31.400  
  and that they decided that they were
going    together  

01:18:31.400   01:18:31.410  
going   to try to put their lives together
  

01:18:31.410   01:18:36.320  
going   to try to put their lives together 
   really  

01:18:36.320   01:18:36.330  
   so that's really
  

01:18:36.330   01:18:37.520  
   so that's really
something    write  

01:18:37.520   01:18:37.530  
something   when they write
  

01:18:37.530   01:18:39.380  
something   when they write
surprised     that  

01:18:39.380   01:18:39.390  
surprised it's like well I decided   that
  

01:18:39.390   01:18:41.330  
surprised it's like well I decided   that
I    was  

01:18:41.330   01:18:41.340  
I   was
  

01:18:41.340   01:18:43.130  
I   was 
   more  

01:18:43.130   01:18:43.140  
   more
  

01:18:43.140   01:18:44.960  
   more
than     I'd  

01:18:44.960   01:18:44.970  
than absolutely   necessary I thought I'd
  

01:18:44.970   01:18:46.880  
than absolutely   necessary I thought I'd
give     for     know  

01:18:46.880   01:18:46.890  
give it   know
  

01:18:46.890   01:18:48.950  
give it   know 
   to  

01:18:48.950   01:18:48.960  
   things started to
  

01:18:48.960   01:18:51.500  
   things started to
happen     it's     how  

01:18:51.500   01:18:51.510  
happen to me it's   like maybe that's how
  

01:18:51.510   01:18:53.720  
happen to me it's   like maybe that's how
the     works     doesn't  

01:18:53.720   01:18:53.730  
the world works   now obviously it doesn't
  

01:18:53.730   01:18:55.400  
the world works   now obviously it doesn't 
   right  

01:18:55.400   01:18:55.410  
   like that all the time right
  

01:18:55.410   01:18:57.110  
   like that all the time right 
   the  

01:18:57.110   01:18:57.120  
   sliced off at the
  

01:18:57.120   01:18:58.850  
   sliced off at the
knees     arbitrary  

01:18:58.850   01:18:58.860  
knees I mean there's an arbitrary
 

01:18:58.860   01:19:01.520  
knees I mean there's an arbitrary
element   can't  

01:19:01.520   01:19:01.530  
element   to existence that that you can't
  

01:19:01.530   01:19:04.930  
element   to existence that that you can't
wish     away     that  

01:19:04.930   01:19:04.940  
wish away   but that doesn't mean that
  

01:19:04.940   01:19:08.930  
wish away   but that doesn't mean that
there     mean     there  

01:19:08.930   01:19:08.940  
there are it   that there
  

01:19:08.940   01:19:10.340  
there are it   that there
aren't    good  

01:19:10.340   01:19:10.350  
aren't   bad strategies and good
  

01:19:10.350   01:19:14.510  
aren't   bad strategies and good
strategies     of  

01:19:14.510   01:19:14.520  
strategies and so I do   think that one of
  

01:19:14.520   01:19:15.590  
strategies and so I do   think that one of
the     existential  

01:19:15.590   01:19:15.600  
the   most fundamental existential
  

01:19:15.600   01:19:18.320  
the   most fundamental existential
questions     going  

01:19:18.320   01:19:18.330

then down and   it's order chaos order 
   well  

01:23:07.250   01:23:07.260  
  chaos and then you have to think well
  

01:23:07.260   01:23:09.170  
  chaos and then you have to think well
are     or  

01:23:09.170   01:23:09.180  
are you the   order or you the chaos or

01:35:09.820   01:35:09.830  
helps a lot if   you if there's a flood
  

01:35:09.830   01:35:11.440  
helps a lot if   you if there's a flood

01:35:11.440   01:35:11.450  
   you have a boat it's like you can
  

01:35:11.450   01:35:13.420  
   you have a boat it's like you can
float     flood     not  

01:35:13.420   01:35:13.430  
float   and then it's not
  

01:35:13.430   01:35:18.460  
float   and then it's not
such     problem     to  

01:35:18.460   01:35:18.470  
such a   refuse to
  

01:35:18.470   01:35:21.460  
such a   refuse to 
   going  

01:35:21.460   01:35:21.470  
   that things are going
  

01:35:21.470   01:35:23.509  
   that things are going 
   bad  

01:35:23.509   01:35:23.519  
   be going downhill bad
  

01:35:23.519   01:35:25.520  
   be going downhill bad
and     at  

01:35:25.520   01:35:25.530  
and that you're going   to be in a pit at
  

01:35:25.530   01:35:27.859  
and that you're going   to be in a pit at
some     and     perhaps  

01:35:27.859   01:35:27.869  
some point you and   your family perhaps
  

01:35:27.869   01:35:31.549  
some point you and   your family perhaps
then     bad  

01:35:31.549   01:35:31.559  
then when it happens it will   be as bad
  

01:35:31.559   01:35:34.450  
then when it happens it will   be as bad
as     you're  

01:35:34.450   01:35:34.460  
as   it possibly can be but if you're
  

01:35:34.460   01:35:38.140  
as   it possibly can be but if you're
awake     then  

01:35:38.140   01:35:38.150  
awake and alert to   that possibility then
  

01:35:38.150   01:35:44.660  
awake and alert to   that possibility then
you     was  

01:35:44.660   01:35:44.670  
you can mitigate   it and the dearth was
  

01:35:44.670   01:35:45.950  
you can mitigate   it and the dearth was

   putting
  

01:40:17.290   01:40:18.780  
   putting
your     individual

01:40:21.480   01:40:21.490  
family's house in   let's say
  

01:40:21.490   01:40:23.430  
family's house in   let's say
reversed     story  

01:40:23.430   01:40:23.440  
reversed a little bit in this story
 

01:40:23.440   01:40:25.530  
reversed a little bit in this story
   and  

01:40:25.530   01:40:25.540  
   and
  

01:40:25.540   01:40:28.950

then he puts the state of Egypt in order
   interesting  

01:40:30.060   01:40:30.070  
  which is really quite interesting
  

01:40:30.070   01:40:32.310  
  which is really quite interesting
because     is     tyranny  

01:40:32.310   01:40:32.320  
   the canonical tyranny
  

01:40:32.320   01:40:34.920  
   the canonical tyranny 
   the  

01:40:34.920   01:40:34.930  
   Testament and so the
  

01:40:34.930   01:40:37.140  
   Testament and so the
idea     that     the  

01:40:37.140   01:40:37.150  
idea is very very clear here that   the
  

01:40:37.150   01:40:39.300  
idea is very very clear here that   the
person     colors  

01:40:39.300   01:40:39.310  
person who   wears the coat of many colors
  

01:40:39.310   01:40:42.300  
person who   wears the coat of many colors
can     the  

01:40:42.300   01:40:42.310  
can put the tyranny right   and then the
  

01:40:42.310   01:40:44.070  
can put the tyranny right   and then the
next    his  

01:40:44.070   01:40:44.080  
next   to put his
  

01:40:44.080   01:40:46.020  
next   to put his
family     right     the  

01:40:46.020   01:40:46.030  
family   the
  

01:40:46.030   01:40:47.460  
family   the
progression     right  

01:40:47.460   01:40:47.470  
progression   would be put yourself right
  

01:40:47.470   01:40:49.230  
progression   would be put yourself right 
   the  

01:40:49.230   01:40:49.240  
  then put your family right then put the
  

01:40:49.240   01:40:50.790  
  then put your family right then put the
state     that     it  

01:40:50.790   01:40:50.800  
state right   it
  

01:40:50.800   01:40:52.410  
state right   it
doesn't     do     a  

01:40:52.410   01:40:52.420  
doesn't really   it in a
  

01:40:52.420   01:40:53.940  
doesn't really   it in a
different     probably     too  

01:40:53.940   01:40:53.950  
different   too
  

01:40:53.950   01:40:57.570  
different   too
but    end  

01:40:57.570   01:40:57.580  
   that's what happens at the end
  

01:40:57.580   01:41:01.590  
   that's what happens at the end
of     you     is  

01:41:01.590   01:41:01.600  
   is
  

01:41:01.600   01:41:03.240  
   is
doing     the  

01:41:03.240   01:41:03.250  
doing pretty   damn well and so is the
  

01:41:03.250   01:41:05.310  
doing pretty   damn well and so is the
state     that     good  

01:41:05.310   01:41:05.320  
state   that isn't good
  

01:41:05.320   01:41:07.800  
state   that isn't good
enough    be  

01:41:07.800   01:41:07.810  
enough   be
  

01:41:07.810   01:41:10.730  
enough   be
functional     properly  

01:41:10.730   01:41:10.740  
functional and put together properly
 

01:41:10.740   01:41:13.620  
functional and put together properly
   to  

01:41:13.620   01:41:13.630  
  even though they did terrible things to
  

01:41:13.630   01:41:16.440  
  even though they did terrible things to 
   because  

01:41:16.440   01:41:16.450  
   and that's very interesting because
  

01:41:16.450   01:41:18.960  
   and that's very interesting because
once     you

02:12:29.179   02:12:29.189  
zero   in on the like with each of the
  

02:12:29.189   02:12:31.100  
zero   in on the like with each of the
phrases    I  

02:12:31.100   02:12:31.110  
phrases   that we went through today I
  

02:12:31.110   02:12:32.569  
phrases   that we went through today I
probably     ten     different  

02:12:32.569   02:12:32.579  
probably looked at   different
  

02:12:32.579   02:12:35.989  
probably looked at   different
commentaries     this  

02:12:35.989   02:12:35.999  
commentaries   and so and then I have this
  

02:12:35.999   02:12:38.750  
commentaries   and so and then I have this
underlying     that  

02:12:38.750   02:12:38.760  
underlying psychoanalytic knowledge that
 

02:12:38.760   02:12:42.350  
underlying psychoanalytic knowledge that
it's     sort    of  

02:12:42.350   02:12:42.360  
it's sort   of like if you have a bunch of
  

02:12:42.360   02:12:44.239  
it's sort   of like if you have a bunch of
different     things  

02:12:44.239   02:12:44.249  
  different templates to look at things
  

02:12:44.249   02:12:46.609  
  different templates to look at things
through     shines  

02:12:46.609   02:12:46.619  
through and then something shines
 

02:12:46.619   02:12:48.500  
through and then something shines
through     same 

02:12:48.500   02:12:48.510  
through all those templates at the same
 

02:12:48.510   02:12:50.929  
through all those templates at the same
time     that's    then  

02:12:50.929   02:12:50.939  
time that's   very unlikely and so then
  

02:12:50.939   02:12:55.549  
time that's   very unlikely and so then
you     one  

02:12:55.549   02:12:55.559  
you can you know a coincidence is one
 

02:12:55.559   02:12:57.469  
you can you know a coincidence is one
thing     but    no  

02:12:57.469   02:12:57.479  
thing but   five coincidences that's no
  

02:12:57.479   02:12:59.060  
thing but   five coincidences that's no
longer     something  

02:12:59.060   02:12:59.070  
longer a coincidence that's something
 

02:12:59.070   02:13:01.549  
longer a coincidence that's something
else   that  

02:13:01.549   02:13:01.559  
else   and so I think I'm hoping that
  

02:13:01.559   02:13:03.439  
else   and so I think I'm hoping that
despite     many  

02:13:03.439   02:13:03.449  
despite the   fact that there's many many
  

02:13:03.449   02:13:05.899  
despite the   fact that there's many many
things     there's  

02:13:05.899   02:13:05.909  
  things that I don't know that there's
  

02:13:05.909   02:13:07.759  
  things that I don't know that there's
enough     of  

02:13:07.759   02:13:07.769  
enough things   that I do know to kind of
  

02:13:07.769   02:13:09.229  
enough things   that I do know to kind of
weave     way     some  

02:13:09.229   02:13:09.239  
weave my way   through this with some
  

02:13:09.239   02:13:13.279  
weave my way   through this with some
degree     yeah  

02:13:13.279   02:13:13.289  
degree of utility if not certainty yeah
 

02:13:13.289   02:13:14.929  
degree of utility if not certainty yeah
   part  

02:13:14.929   02:13:14.939  
  cuz I just which is the second part
  

02:13:14.939   02:13:16.310  
  cuz I just which is the second part
which     but  

02:13:16.310   02:13:16.320  
  which I guess maybe you don't know but
  

02:13:16.320   02:13:18.469  
  which I guess maybe you don't know but
the     Jewish     stories

that date back   almost
as     long     a  

02:13:21.470   02:13:21.480  
as long   which fill in a
  

02:13:21.480   02:13:25.070  
as long   which fill in a
lot    so  

02:13:25.070   02:13:25.080  
lot   ly crazy random so

complicated     comprehension  

02:14:32.810   02:14:32.820  
complicated beyond comprehension
 

02:14:32.820   02:14:34.550  
complicated beyond comprehension
right   bit  

02:14:34.550   02:14:34.560  
right   very little bit
  

02:14:34.560   02:14:36.860  
right   very little bit 
   your  

02:14:36.860   02:14:36.870  
  of it and the way you structure your
  

02:14:36.870   02:14:38.480  
  of it and the way you structure your
understanding     assumptions  

02:14:38.480   02:14:38.490  
understanding is you make assumptions
 

02:14:38.490   02:14:40.520  
understanding is you make assumptions
   simplifying  

02:14:40.520   02:14:40.530  
  about things and they're simplifying
  

02:14:40.530   02:14:43.180  
  about things and they're simplifying
assumptions     trust     you  

02:14:43.180   02:14:43.190  
assumptions so if you trust   someone you
  

02:14:43.190   02:14:46.610  
assumptions so if you trust   someone you 
   right  

02:14:46.610   02:14:46.620  
   right
  

02:14:46.620   02:14:48.910  
   right
because     married  

02:14:48.910   02:14:48.920  
because like   let's say we were married
  

02:14:48.920   02:14:51.410  
because like   let's say we were married 
   that  

02:14:51.410   02:14:51.420  
   bunch of ways that
  

02:14:51.420   02:14:52.970  
   bunch of ways that
you're     are     be  

02:14:52.970   02:14:52.980  
you're going   be
  

02:14:52.980   02:14:56.240  
you're going   be
simpler     I     tolerate  

02:14:56.240   02:14:56.250  
simpler okay so then I   can tolerate
  

02:14:56.250   02:14:58.250  
simpler okay so then I   can tolerate
being     because  

02:14:58.250   02:14:58.260  
being   around you in some sense because
  

02:14:58.260   02:15:02.380  
being   around you in some sense because
you're     once  

02:15:02.380   02:15:02.390  
 
 

02:15:02.390   02:15:06.820  
 
now   are  

02:15:06.820   02:15:06.830  
now   those simplifying structures are
  

02:15:06.830   02:15:09.740  
now   those simplifying structures are
hierarchically     of  

02:15:09.740   02:15:09.750  
hierarchically assembled and some of
 

02:15:09.750   02:15:11.440  
hierarchically assembled and some of
them     important    others  

02:15:11.440   02:15:11.450  
them are far more important   than others
  

02:15:11.450   02:15:13.850  
them are far more important   than others 
   in  

02:15:13.850   02:15:13.860  
  Trust is one of them especially trust in
  

02:15:13.860   02:15:15.470  
  Trust is one of them especially trust in
loved     why  

02:15:15.470   02:15:15.480  
loved ones   family members which is why
  

02:15:15.480   02:15:17.150  
loved ones   family members which is why
betrayal     really  

02:15:17.150   02:15:17.160  
betrayal by a family   member is really
  

02:15:17.160   02:15:19.760  
betrayal by a family   member is really
catastrophic    it  

02:15:19.760   02:15:19.770  
catastrophic   because it you know it
  

02:15:19.770   02:15:21.980  
catastrophic   because it you know it

  collapses and that's an ego death
  

02:15:32.599   02:15:36.459  
  collapses and that's an ego death
and     as  

02:15:36.459   02:15:36.469

   another structure
  

02:15:38.300   02:15:40.810  
   another structure
that     the     is  

02:15:40.810   02:15:40.820  
that   self is

   constant across
ego     deaths     less  

02:15:48.639   02:15:48.649  
ego deaths   but it's it's deeper and less
  

02:15:48.649   02:15:49.479  
ego deaths   but it's it's deeper and less

02:15:52.909   02:15:54.580  
   and it's the thing that
the     it

the Eagle collapses into   when it
  

02:15:54.590   02:15:56.679  
the Eagle collapses into   when it
collapses    ego  

02:15:56.679   02:15:56.689  
collapses   and then that rebuilds the ego
  

02:15:56.689   02:15:59.739  
collapses   and then that rebuilds the ego
something     like     but  

02:15:59.739   02:15:59.749  
   that across time but
  

02:15:59.749   02:16:02.349  
   that across time but
that's     there's  

02:16:02.349   02:16:02.359  
that's when an ego death is now there's
 

02:16:02.359   02:16:04.060  
that's when an ego death is now there's
variants     of    a  

02:16:04.060   02:16:04.070  
variants of   a
  

02:16:04.070   02:16:07.419  
variants of   a
voluntary     a  

02:16:07.419   02:16:07.429  
voluntary or involuntary ego death   and a
  

02:16:07.429   02:16:09.310  
voluntary or involuntary ego death   and a
voluntary     learn     a  

02:16:09.310   02:16:09.320  
voluntary ego death is   a
  

02:16:09.320   02:16:11.889  
voluntary ego death is   a
bunch     and     so  

02:16:11.889   02:16:11.899  
bunch and   so
  

02:16:11.899   02:16:14.020  
bunch and   so
that     your     it's  

02:16:14.020   02:16:14.030  
   own emulation it's
  

02:16:14.030   02:16:15.580  
   own emulation it's
like     a     Phoenix  

02:16:15.580   02:16:15.590  
like   Phoenix
  

02:16:15.590   02:16:17.159  
like   Phoenix
and    fire  

02:16:17.159   02:16:17.169  
and   your lighting yourself on fire
  

02:16:17.169   02:16:19.810  
and   your lighting yourself on fire
that's     even     it  

02:16:19.810   02:16:19.820  
that's a much better idea even   though it
  

02:16:19.820   02:16:22.299  
that's a much better idea even   though it
can     be     the  

02:16:22.299   02:16:22.309  
can still be   really harsh the
  

02:16:22.309   02:16:24.339  
can still be   really harsh the
involuntary     deaths     really  

02:16:24.339   02:16:24.349  
involuntary   they're really
  

02:16:24.349   02:16:25.810  
involuntary   they're really
hard     almost  

02:16:25.810   02:16:25.820  
hard on people   people will do almost
  

02:16:25.820   02:16:27.939  
hard on people   people will do almost
anything     stop     happening

simplifications   it's not surprising 
   like  

02:16:40.809   02:16:40.819  
   like
  

02:16:40.819   02:16:42.339  
   like
that     the  

02:16:42.339   02:16:42.349  
that   ego death is a journey into the
  

02:16:42.349   02:16:44.410  
that   ego death is a journey into the
underworld     or     chaos  

02:16:44.410   02:16:44.420  
   it's a collapse into chaos
  

02:16:44.420   02:16:46.149  
   it's a collapse into chaos
and    it  

02:16:46.149   02:16:46.159  
   that's not so bad if you do it
  

02:16:46.159   02:16:48.790  
   that's not so bad if you do it
purposefully     the     story  

02:16:48.790   02:16:48.800  
purposefully   story
  

02:16:48.800   02:16:50.229  
purposefully   story
for     example     by  

02:16:50.229   02:16:50.239  
for example   exemplified by
  

02:16:50.239   02:16:52.000  
for example   exemplified by
Pinocchio     to  

02:16:52.000   02:16:52.010  
Pinocchio going down to the depths to
 

02:16:52.010   02:16:53.830  
Pinocchio going down to the depths to
rescue     father    he  

02:16:53.830   02:16:53.840  
rescue his father   from the whale now he
  

02:16:53.840   02:16:55.540  
rescue his father   from the whale now he
does     near  

02:16:55.540   02:16:55.550  
does that voluntarily   but a damn near
  

02:16:55.550   02:16:57.580  
does that voluntarily   but a damn near
kills     right     he  

02:16:57.580   02:16:57.590  
kills it   first of all he
  

02:16:57.590   02:17:00.459  
kills it   first of all he
hardly     out     he  

02:17:00.459   02:17:00.469  
hardly gets out   second he
  

02:17:00.469   02:17:02.919  
hardly gets out   second he
actually     comes  

02:17:02.919   02:17:02.929  
actually drowns and   dies but he comes
  

02:17:02.929   02:17:04.839  
actually drowns and   dies but he comes 
   it  

02:17:04.839   02:17:04.849  
   so even if you do it
  

02:17:04.849   02:17:09.009  
   so even if you do it
voluntarily     it's     just  

02:17:09.009   02:17:09.019  
voluntarily   just
  

02:17:09.019   02:17:10.570  
voluntarily   just
better     involuntarily  

02:17:10.570   02:17:10.580  
better than   doing it involuntarily
  

02:17:10.580   02:17:12.459  
better than   doing it involuntarily
which     alternative     that's  

02:17:12.459   02:17:12.469  
which is the other   so that's
  

02:17:12.469   02:17:22.919  
which is the other   so that's
what     Doctor     Buddhism  

02:17:22.919   02:17:22.929

  think but the word he used was bizarre I
  

02:17:50.069   02:17:53.780  
  think but the word he used was bizarre I 
   so  

02:17:53.780   02:17:53.790  
   so
  

02:17:53.790   02:17:55.610  
   so

that's   I actually have a sense of humor
  

02:17:55.620   02:17:58.219  
that's   I actually have a sense of humor
it's     believe     it  

02:17:58.219   02:17:58.229  
it's it's hard   that but so it
  

02:17:58.229   02:17:59.809  
it's it's hard   that but so it
sort     not     feeling  

02:17:59.809   02:17:59.819  
sort of comes   feeling
  

02:17:59.819   02:18:01.959

02:18:18.500   02:18:20.780  
jokes are landing more   all right 
   element  

02:18:20.780   02:18:20.790  
  but then there's this third element
  

02:18:20.790   02:18:23.959  
  but then there's this third element 
   quit  

02:18:23.959   02:18:23.969  
  which I think was what Steve Martin quit
  

02:18:23.969   02:18:25.940  
  which I think was what Steve Martin quit
because     I     the  

02:18:25.940   02:18:25.950  
because   think the
  

02:18:25.950   02:18:27.950  
because   think the
audience     and  

02:18:27.950   02:18:27.960  
audience   is anticipating jokes more and
  

02:18:27.960   02:18:29.870  
audience   is anticipating jokes more and
they're    noticed  

02:18:29.870   02:18:29.880  
they're   actually you know I've noticed
  

02:18:29.880   02:18:31.400  
they're   actually you know I've noticed
people     that  

02:18:31.400   02:18:31.410  
people   laughing more at things that
  

02:18:31.410   02:18:33.349  
people   laughing more at things that
aren't     intending     was  

02:18:33.349   02:18:33.359  
   to be jokes so I was

   and
they're     they're  

02:18:37.730   02:18:37.740  
  they're intended I'm hoping they're

  they're intended I'm hoping they're
intended     straight  

02:18:39.530   02:18:39.540  
intended just   because I keep a straight
  

02:18:39.540   02:18:41.209  
intended just   because I keep a straight
face     intended  

02:18:41.209   02:18:41.219  
face doesn't mean they're   not intended
  

02:18:41.219   02:18:44.480  
face doesn't mean they're   not intended

02:18:46.849   02:18:46.859  
one of the   things is like it's and I try
  

02:18:46.859   02:18:49.280  
one of the   things is like it's and I try
to     probably  

02:18:49.280   02:18:49.290  
  to keep this and the wild goal probably
  

02:18:49.290   02:18:51.110  
  to keep this and the wild goal probably
about     years     when  

02:18:51.110   02:18:51.120  
about five   ago that even when
  

02:18:51.120   02:18:52.129  
about five   ago that even when
you're     dealing     serious  

02:18:52.129   02:18:52.139  
you're dealing   with really serious
  

02:18:52.139   02:18:54.709  
you're dealing   with really serious
matters     it  

02:18:54.709   02:18:54.719  
  matters that if you're not handling it
  

02:18:54.719   02:18:56.540  
  matters that if you're not handling it 
   expert  

02:18:56.540   02:18:56.550  
   you're not an expert
  

02:18:56.550   02:18:58.309  
   you're not an expert 
   and  

02:18:58.309   02:18:58.319  
   you know what a master out it and
  

02:18:58.319   02:18:59.690  
   you know what a master out it and
you     things  

02:18:59.690   02:18:59.700  
you think   well there are some things
  

02:18:59.700   02:19:01.669  
you think   well there are some things 
   can't  

02:19:01.669   02:19:01.679  
  that are so deep and dark that you can't
  

02:19:01.679   02:19:04.549  
  that are so deep and dark that you can't 
   that's  

02:19:04.549   02:19:04.559  
   touch and that's
  

02:19:04.559   02:19:07.309  
   touch and that's 
   doesn't  

02:19:07.309   02:19:07.319  
  actually not true you can that doesn't
  

02:19:07.319   02:19:09.110  
  actually not true you can that doesn't
mean     it     doesn't  

02:19:09.110   02:19:09.120  
mean you make light of   doesn't
  

02:19:09.120   02:19:10.520  
mean you make light of   doesn't
mean     you  

02:19:10.520   02:19:10.530  
  mean anything like that it's that you
  

02:19:10.530   02:19:14.389

02:23:18.450   02:23:18.460  
dogma   that held that good and evil were
  

02:23:18.460   02:23:20.700  
dogma   that held that good and evil were
separate     that  

02:23:20.700   02:23:20.710  
separate metaphysical realities and that
 

02:23:20.710   02:23:23.280  
separate metaphysical realities and that
they     battling    for  

02:23:23.280   02:23:23.290  
they were battling   the for
  

02:23:23.290   02:23:25.650  
they were battling   the for
governance     like  

02:23:25.650   02:23:25.660  
governance of the cosmos something like
 

02:23:25.660   02:23:27.490  
governance of the cosmos something like
   independent  

02:23:27.490   02:23:27.500  
  that but they both had an independent
  

02:23:27.500   02:23:30.460  
  that but they both had an independent
and     which  

02:23:30.460   02:23:30.470  
and the classical   Christian idea which
  

02:23:30.470   02:23:32.800  
and the classical   Christian idea which 
   good  

02:23:32.800   02:23:32.810  
   no that good
  

02:23:32.810   02:23:34.780  
   no that good
was     of  

02:23:34.780   02:23:34.790  
was real but evil was the absence of
 

02:23:34.790   02:23:36.820  
was real but evil was the absence of
good   the  

02:23:36.820   02:23:36.830  
good   now that produced all sorts of the
  

02:23:36.830   02:23:38.680  
good   now that produced all sorts of the
absence     all     of  

02:23:38.680   02:23:38.690  
absence of good produces all   sorts of
  

02:23:38.690   02:23:40.900  
absence of good produces all   sorts of 
   to  

02:23:40.900   02:23:40.910  
   and it is interesting to
  

02:23:40.910   02:23:43.120  
   and it is interesting to
read     get     of  

02:23:43.120   02:23:43.130  
read young because he does get   kind of
  

02:23:43.130   02:23:45.670  
read young because he does get   kind of 
   think  

02:23:45.670   02:23:45.680  
  Manichean in his discussions and I think
  

02:23:45.680   02:23:46.690  
  Manichean in his discussions and I think
it     because     so  

02:23:46.690   02:23:46.700  
it was partly because   was so
  

02:23:46.700   02:23:48.670  
it was partly because   was so
concerned    Nazi  

02:23:48.670   02:23:48.680  
concerned   about what happened in Nazi
  

02:23:48.680   02:23:50.740  
concerned   about what happened in Nazi 
   war  

02:23:50.740   02:23:50.750  
   cold war
  

02:23:50.750   02:23:52.330  
   cold war
afterwards     know     seemed  

02:23:52.330   02:23:52.340  
afterwards   because evil seemed
  

02:23:52.340   02:23:56.200  
afterwards   because evil seemed
to     palpable     think  

02:23:56.200   02:23:56.210  
to be a palpable   force but I don't think
  

02:23:56.210   02:23:59.620  
to be a palpable   force but I don't think
that     as     do  

02:23:59.620   02:23:59.630  
that it's as   powerful as good but I do
  

02:23:59.630   02:24:01.240  
that it's as   powerful as good but I do
think    multiply  

02:24:01.240   02:24:01.250  
think   it's easier for it to multiply
  

02:24:01.250   02:24:04.840  
think   it's easier for it to multiply
because     it's  

02:24:04.840   02:24:04.850  
  because it's what's easier path it's
  

02:24:04.850   02:24:07.030  
  because it's what's easier path it's
easy     and  

02:24:07.030   02:24:07.040  
easy to be resentful   and hostile and
  

02:24:07.040   02:24:09.940  
easy to be resentful   and hostile and 
   easy  

02:24:09.940   02:24:09.950  
  bitter and and do nothing that's easy
  

02:24:09.950   02:24:12.160  
  bitter and and do nothing that's easy 
   people  

02:24:12.160   02:24:12.170  
   horrible and it's hard on people
  

02:24:12.170   02:24:13.420  
   horrible and it's hard on people
but     it     tremendous  

02:24:13.420   02:24:13.430  
   doesn't require a tremendous
  

02:24:13.430   02:24:16.090  
   doesn't require a tremendous 
   that  

02:24:16.090   02:24:16.100  
   so maybe that
  

02:24:16.100   02:24:18.160  
   so maybe that
is     final  

02:24:18.160   02:24:18.170  
is   why it's multiplied in the final
  

02:24:18.170   02:24:20.890  
is   why it's multiplied in the final 
   been  

02:24:20.890   02:24:20.900

over all yeah well the love issue   see
I've     about  

02:24:54.580   02:24:54.590  
I've been saying I thought a lot   about
  

02:24:54.590   02:24:56.290  
I've been saying I thought a lot   about 
   truth  

02:24:56.290   02:24:56.300  
   love and truth
  

02:24:56.300   02:24:58.510  
   love and truth
because     I've     lot  

02:24:58.510   02:24:58.520  
because I've   lot
  

02:24:58.520   02:25:00.700  
because I've   lot
more     think     partly  

02:25:00.700   02:25:00.710  
more about truth and I think   partly
  

02:25:00.710   02:25:02.110  
more about truth and I think   partly
that's     because     you  

02:25:02.110   02:25:02.120  
that's because   a word that you
  

02:25:02.120   02:25:04.920  
that's because   a word that you
can    so  

02:25:04.920   02:25:04.930  
   hardly even say because it's been so
  

02:25:04.930   02:25:07.390  
   hardly even say because it's been so
it's     a  

02:25:07.390   02:25:07.400  
it's like it's   being dragged behind a
  

02:25:07.400   02:25:09.130  
it's like it's   being dragged behind a
car     something  

02:25:09.130   02:25:09.140  
car through mud puddles it's something
 

02:25:09.140   02:25:11.620  
car through mud puddles it's something
like     but    just  

02:25:11.620   02:25:11.630  
like that but   just
  

02:25:11.630   02:25:13.720  
like that but   just
finish     but     I  

02:25:13.720   02:25:13.730  
finish   I
  

02:25:13.730   02:25:16.600  
finish   I
think    is  

02:25:16.600   02:25:16.610  
think   that the the love idea is
  

02:25:16.610   02:25:19.480  
think   that the the love idea is
associated     least     with  

02:25:19.480   02:25:19.490  
associated   with
  

02:25:19.490   02:25:20.860  
associated   with
what     beginning     of  

02:25:20.860   02:25:20.870  
what I discussed at the beginning   of
  

02:25:20.870   02:25:23.320  
what I discussed at the beginning   of
this     I  

02:25:23.320   02:25:23.330  
this   lecture with regards to faith I
  

02:25:23.330   02:25:25.210  
this   lecture with regards to faith I
think     decision     about  

02:25:25.210   02:25:25.220  
think   about
  

02:25:25.220   02:25:28.030  
think   about 
   is  

02:25:28.030   02:25:28.040  
  what your attitude towards being is
  

02:25:28.040   02:25:31.060  
  what your attitude towards being is 
   in  

02:25:31.060   02:25:31.070  
  going to be and the proper attitude in
  

02:25:31.070   02:25:33.670  
  going to be and the proper attitude in 
   for  

02:25:33.670   02:25:33.680  
   for
  

02:25:33.680   02:25:36.220  
   for
its     maybe  

02:25:36.220   02:25:36.230  
its betterment   you know and so maybe
  

02:25:36.230   02:25:38.500  
its betterment   you know and so maybe
maybe     towards  

02:25:38.500   02:25:38.510  
maybe you have the same   attitude towards
  

02:25:38.510   02:25:39.650  
maybe you have the same   attitude towards
being     do  

02:25:39.650   02:25:39.660  
being as you do
 

02:25:39.660   02:25:41.990  
being as you do
towards     like    son  

02:25:41.990   02:25:42.000  
towards someone that you love like   a son
  

02:25:42.000   02:25:44.030  
towards someone that you love like   a son
or     or     want  

02:25:44.030   02:25:44.040  
or a daughter or   that you want
  

02:25:44.040   02:25:47.060  
or a daughter or   that you want
things    that's  

02:25:47.060   02:25:47.070  
things   that so that's
  

02:25:47.070   02:25:50.000  
things   that so that's
your     aim  

02:25:50.000   02:25:50.010  
your aim so the aim is basically the aim
 

02:25:50.010   02:25:54.410  
your aim so the aim is basically the aim
is     motivated    to  

02:25:54.410   02:25:54.420  
is motivated   by love you want things to
  

02:25:54.420   02:25:55.940  
is motivated   by love you want things to 
   good  

02:25:55.940   02:25:55.950  
   because I think that's a good
  

02:25:55.950   02:25:57.920  
   because I think that's a good 
   really  

02:25:57.920   02:25:57.930  
  definition of love like if you really
  

02:25:57.930   02:25:59.900  
  definition of love like if you really
care     for     because  

02:25:59.900   02:25:59.910  
care for   someone you can tell because
  

02:25:59.910   02:26:02.000  
care for   someone you can tell because
you     them  

02:26:02.000   02:26:02.010  
you want things   to be better for them
  

02:26:02.010   02:26:04.280  
you want things   to be better for them 
   inside  

02:26:04.280   02:26:04.290  
  and then I think truth is nested inside
  

02:26:04.290   02:26:06.261  
  and then I think truth is nested inside
that     think     the  

02:26:06.261   02:26:06.271  
that because I think   truth is the
  

02:26:06.271   02:26:08.330  
that because I think   truth is the 
   like  

02:26:08.330   02:26:08.340  
  best servant of love it's something like
  

02:26:08.340   02:26:16.761  
  best servant of love it's something like 
   an  

02:26:16.761   02:26:16.771  
   an
  

02:26:16.771   02:26:18.500  
   an
idea     thinking     maybe

rejecting     and     how  

02:27:23.690   02:27:23.700  
rejecting and   figure out how
  

02:27:23.700   02:27:25.430  
rejecting and   figure out how
to     in  

02:27:25.430   02:27:25.440  
  to bring them into into the folder in
  

02:27:25.440   02:27:27.470  
  to bring them into into the folder in 
   I  

02:27:27.470   02:27:27.480  
   hole so he's got this quote that I
  

02:27:27.480   02:27:30.290  
   hole so he's got this quote that I
really     like     behold  

02:27:30.290   02:27:30.300  
really like   is I'd rather behold
  

02:27:30.300   02:27:33.320  
really like   is I'd rather behold 
   hand  

02:27:33.320   02:27:33.330  
  and good right right so so on one hand
  

02:27:33.330   02:27:35.780  
  and good right right so so on one hand
you    problem  

02:27:35.780   02:27:35.790  
you   something as a problem
  

02:27:35.790   02:27:37.430  
you   something as a problem
and     rid     it  

02:27:37.430   02:27:37.440  
and you   of it or burn it
  

02:27:37.440   02:27:40.011  
and you   of it or burn it
off    seems  

02:27:40.011   02:27:40.021  
off   but then on the other hand it seems
  

02:27:40.021   02:27:44.780  
off   but then on the other hand it seems
like     stronger     is  

02:27:44.780   02:27:44.790  
like the   is
  

02:27:44.790   02:27:46.881  
like the   is
to    everything  

02:27:46.881   02:27:46.891  
to   out how to put everything
  

02:27:46.891   02:27:49.940  
to   out how to put everything 
   one  

02:27:49.940   02:27:49.950  
   so there's that there's a one
  

02:27:49.950   02:27:51.350  
   so there's that there's a one
of     the     his  

02:27:51.350   02:27:51.360  
of the   Jung wrote about in his
  

02:27:51.360   02:27:53.389  
of the   Jung wrote about in his 
   was  

02:27:53.389   02:27:53.399  
  works on alchemy was
  

02:27:53.399   02:27:56.090  
  works on alchemy was
an     alchemical  

02:27:56.090   02:27:56.100  
an explanation of the prime alchemical
 

02:27:56.100   02:27:59.270  
an explanation of the prime alchemical
dictum     was    which  

02:27:59.270   02:27:59.280  
dictum which was   a coagula which
  

02:27:59.280   02:28:03.380  
dictum which was   a coagula which
meant     so  

02:28:03.380   02:28:03.390  
meant dissolve and integrate right   so so
  

02:28:03.390   02:28:06.320  
meant dissolve and integrate right   so so
imagine     this     you  

02:28:06.320   02:28:06.330  
imagine this   imagine you
  

02:28:06.330   02:28:10.520  
imagine this   imagine you
had     father     not  

02:28:10.520   02:28:10.530  
had a fairly   who was not
  

02:28:10.530   02:28:13.060  
had a fairly   who was not
very     well     aggression

very   controlled in his aggression
  

02:28:13.070   02:28:15.620  
very   controlled in his aggression
decent    let's  

02:28:15.620   02:28:15.630  
decent   that but let's
  

02:28:15.630   02:28:18.170  
decent   that but let's
say    I'm  

02:28:18.170   02:28:18.180  
say   that and so your reaction is I'm
  

02:28:18.180   02:28:20.750  
say   that and so your reaction is I'm
never     aggressive     so  

02:28:20.750   02:28:20.760  
never going to be aggressive   and so
  

02:28:20.760   02:28:22.929  
never going to be aggressive   and so
you've     structure  

02:28:22.929   02:28:22.939  
you've built   a like a moral structure
  

02:28:22.939   02:28:26.530  
you've built   a like a moral structure 
   and

   and
  

02:28:26.540   02:28:29.090  
   and
there's     around  

02:28:29.090   02:28:29.100  
there's possibility floating around
 

02:28:29.100   02:28:31.520  
there's possibility floating around
   an  

02:28:31.520   02:28:31.530

what do you do with   the part of you
that's     potentially  

02:31:04.381   02:31:04.391  
that's   aggressive and and potentially
  

02:31:04.391   02:31:06.390  
that's   aggressive and and potentially
malevolent     crush     that's  

02:31:06.390   02:31:06.400  
malevolent   it that's
  

02:31:06.400   02:31:08.280  
malevolent   it that's
the     do  

02:31:08.280   02:31:08.290  
the   super-ego response in some sense do
  

02:31:08.290   02:31:10.201  
the   super-ego response in some sense do
you     to     speak

you just put it behind you so to   speak
  

02:31:10.211   02:31:13.560  
you just put it behind you so to   speak
is     that     to  

02:31:13.560   02:31:13.570  
is that   to
  

02:31:13.570   02:31:15.661  
is that   to
its     existence     game  

02:31:15.661   02:31:15.671  
its existence   and bring it into the game

its existence   and bring it into the game
and     sense  

02:31:20.371   02:31:20.381  
and that's see for Freud in some sense
 

02:31:20.381   02:31:22.890  
and that's see for Freud in some sense
morality     down    on  

02:31:22.890   02:31:22.900  
morality was super-ego clamping down   on

different idea   think they were
  

02:31:29.080   02:31:31.711  
different idea   think they were
right     bad  

02:31:31.711   02:31:31.721  
right it's like no   no you invite the bad
  

02:31:31.721   02:31:35.400  
right it's like no   no you invite the bad
guys     out     an  

02:31:35.400   02:31:35.410  
guys out   to play and so you're an

guys out   to play and so you're an
aggressive    it's  

02:31:38.490   02:31:38.500  
aggressive   hockey player but it's
  

02:31:38.500   02:31:40.890  
aggressive   hockey player but it's
disciplined     aggression     you  

02:31:40.890   02:31:40.900  
disciplined aggression   that makes you
  

02:31:40.900   02:31:43.230  
disciplined aggression   that makes you
gives     access     of

02:31:45.121   02:31:45.131  
energy you wouldn't otherwise have and
 

02:31:45.131   02:31:46.980  
energy you wouldn't otherwise have and
then     sexuality    like  

02:31:46.980   02:31:46.990  
then with regards to sexuality   it's like
  

02:31:46.990   02:31:49.230  
then with regards to sexuality   it's like
well     doesn't  

02:31:49.230   02:31:49.240  
well   untrammeled promiscuity doesn't

unavoidable virginity right in fact I
 

02:31:55.540   02:31:58.081  
unavoidable virginity right in fact I
think   masks  

02:31:58.081   02:31:58.091  
think   also masks
  

02:31:58.091   02:32:00.600  
think   also masks
itself     virtue     you  

02:32:00.600   02:32:00.610

  you should be able to do things that you

  you should be able to do things that you 
   the  

02:32:07.750   02:32:07.760  
  wouldn't do that's that's like the
  

02:32:07.760   02:32:10.570  
  wouldn't do that's that's like the
definition     person  

02:32:10.570   02:32:10.580  
  definition of a genuinely moral person
  

02:32:10.580   02:32:14.740  
  definition of a genuinely moral person
they    that  

02:32:14.740   02:32:14.750  
they   could do it but they don't and that
  

02:32:14.750   02:32:17.950  
they   could do it but they don't and that 
   you  

02:32:17.950   02:32:17.960  
  that's not cowardice and so that's you
  

02:32:17.960   02:32:19.870  
  that's not cowardice and so that's you
burn     way  

02:32:19.870   02:32:19.880  
burn off the things that get   in the way
  

02:32:19.880   02:32:22.929  
burn off the things that get   in the way 
   say  

02:32:22.929   02:32:22.939  
   so when you say
  

02:32:22.939   02:32:24.700  
   so when you say
dissolve     integrate     good  

02:32:24.700   02:32:24.710  
dissolve and integrate   it'd be a good
  

02:32:24.710   02:32:26.620  
dissolve and integrate   it'd be a good 
   ideas  

02:32:26.620   02:32:26.630  
   the two ideas
  

02:32:26.630   02:32:28.840  
   the two ideas
together     the  

02:32:28.840   02:32:28.850  
together that the burning off and the
 

02:32:28.850   02:32:31.780  
together that the burning off and the
difficult   because  

02:32:31.780   02:32:31.790  
difficult   process is necessary because
  

02:32:31.790   02:32:34.420  
difficult   process is necessary because
the    structured  

02:32:34.420   02:32:34.430  
the   elements of yourself are structured
  

02:32:34.430   02:32:36.729  
the   elements of yourself are structured
together     not  

02:32:36.729   02:32:36.739  
together in a rigid   way that is not
  

02:32:36.739   02:32:38.979  
together in a rigid   way that is not 
   happens  

02:32:38.979   02:32:38.989  
  working properly and that's what happens
  

02:32:38.989   02:32:40.469  
  working properly and that's what happens
to    whale  

02:32:40.469   02:32:40.479  
to   of the whale
  

02:32:40.479   02:32:43.750  
to   of the whale 
   presuppositions  

02:32:43.750   02:32:43.760  
  he's so caught in his presuppositions
  

02:32:43.760   02:32:45.939  
  he's so caught in his presuppositions
that     escape     so  

02:32:45.939   02:32:45.949  
that   right and so
  

02:32:45.949   02:32:47.800  
that   right and so
Pinocchio     so  

02:32:47.800   02:32:47.810  
Pinocchio represents the new force so
 

02:32:47.810   02:32:49.510  
Pinocchio represents the new force so
it's     interesting    watch  

02:32:49.510   02:32:49.520  
it's very interesting   so when you watch
  

02:32:49.520   02:32:51.670  
it's very interesting   so when you watch
Pinocchio     first  

02:32:51.670   02:32:51.680  
Pinocchio try to rescue   him the first
  

02:32:51.680   02:32:53.620  
Pinocchio try to rescue   him the first
thing     Pinocchio  

02:32:53.620   02:32:53.630  
thing Geppetto does is confuse Pinocchio
 

02:32:53.630   02:32:55.210  
thing Geppetto does is confuse Pinocchio
with     fish    something  

02:32:55.210   02:32:55.220  
with a fish   because he wants something
  

02:32:55.220   02:32:57.040  
with a fish   because he wants something 
   than  

02:32:57.040   02:32:57.050  
   eat but Pinocchio is better than
  

02:32:57.050   02:32:58.389  
   eat but Pinocchio is better than
something     eat     rescue  

02:32:58.389   02:32:58.399  
something   could rescue
  

02:32:58.399   02:33:00.670  
something   could rescue
him     to     then  

02:33:00.670   02:33:00.680  
him so he   eat and then
  

02:33:00.680   02:33:02.050  
him so he   eat and then
Pinocchio     in  

02:33:02.050   02:33:02.060  
Pinocchio wants to make a fire in

that's   that's the rigid structure
  

02:33:14.659   02:33:16.479  
that's   that's the rigid structure
that's     off

forest   fire that allows for new growth
  

02:33:20.659   02:33:22.750  
forest   fire that allows for new growth
and     put  

02:33:22.750   02:33:22.760  
and   and that's how those things are put
  

02:33:22.760   02:33:24.820  
and   and that's how those things are put
together     it's     to

together   useful to
  

02:33:24.830   02:33:26.530  
together   useful to 
   something

   because if you burn something
  

02:33:26.540   02:33:28.030

well   that's that seems to be a deeper
interpretation     think  

02:37:17.630   02:37:17.640  
interpretation I would say and I   think
  

02:37:17.640   02:37:19.820  
interpretation I would say and I   think
it's     of  

02:37:19.820   02:37:19.830  
it's   more that's the same line of
  

02:37:19.830   02:37:22.099  
it's   more that's the same line of 
   in  

02:37:22.099   02:37:22.109  
   that Dostoevsky pursued in
  

02:37:22.109   02:37:24.590  
   that Dostoevsky pursued in
crime     and     in  

02:37:24.590   02:37:24.600  
crime and   punishment right because in
  

02:37:24.600   02:37:26.510  
crime and   punishment right because in
crime     Raskolnikov     gets  

02:37:26.510   02:37:26.520  
crime and punishment   gets
  

02:37:26.520   02:37:28.550  
crime and punishment   gets 
   cannot  

02:37:28.550   02:37:28.560  
   and then he cannot
  

02:37:28.560   02:37:30.800  
   and then he cannot
stand     it     it  

02:37:30.800   02:37:30.810  
stand it   he cannot stand that he did it
  

02:37:30.810   02:37:31.969  
stand it   he cannot stand that he did it 
   person  

02:37:31.969   02:37:31.979  
   the same person
  

02:37:31.979   02:37:34.460  
   the same person 
   he  

02:37:34.460   02:37:34.470  
   even more he cannot stand that he
  

02:37:34.470   02:37:35.300  
   even more he cannot stand that he
got     with     it  

02:37:35.300   02:37:35.310  
got away   it
  

02:37:35.310   02:37:38.150  
got away   it
so     more     that  

02:37:38.150   02:37:38.160  
so that's more   that
  

02:37:38.160   02:37:41.090  
so that's more   that

02:40:44.661   02:40:44.671  
  self inflicted well I I don't think you
  

02:40:44.671   02:40:47.631  
  self inflicted well I I don't think you
want     contribution  

02:40:47.631   02:40:47.641  
want to   underestimate the contribution
  

02:40:47.641   02:40:51.041  
want to   underestimate the contribution
of     know  

02:40:51.041   02:40:51.051  
of just sheer difficulty like you know
 

02:40:51.051   02:40:56.841  
of just sheer difficulty like you know
let's     grieving 

02:40:56.841   02:40:56.851  
let's say you you you you're grieving
 

02:40:56.851   02:40:59.751  
let's say you you you you're grieving
   it's  

02:40:59.751   02:40:59.761  
  because someone close to you died it's
  

02:40:59.761   02:41:01.071  
  because someone close to you died it's 
   lost  

02:41:01.071   02:41:01.081  
   you've lost
  

02:41:01.081   02:41:02.781  
   you've lost
them    it  

02:41:02.781   02:41:02.791  
them   although that's a big part of it
  

02:41:02.791   02:41:05.690  
them   although that's a big part of it
it's    yourself  

02:41:05.690   02:41:05.700  
it's   that you have to rebuild yourself
  

02:41:05.700   02:41:08.690  
it's   that you have to rebuild yourself
and     and  

02:41:08.690   02:41:08.700  
  and it's really hard to do that so and
  

02:41:08.700   02:41:10.841  
  and it's really hard to do that so and 
   the  

02:41:10.841   02:41:10.851  
  it is sort of proportional to the
  

02:41:10.851   02:41:13.190  
  it is sort of proportional to the
significance     your     you  

02:41:13.190   02:41:13.200  
significance of   error so if you
  

02:41:13.200   02:41:14.810  
significance of   error so if you
commit     recognize  

02:41:14.810   02:41:14.820  
commit an   error and then you recognize
  

02:41:14.820   02:41:16.970  
commit an   error and then you recognize 
   of  

02:41:16.970   02:41:16.980  
   it's an error if it's a sort of
  

02:41:16.980   02:41:18.711  
   it's an error if it's a sort of
surface     you     can  

02:41:18.711   02:41:18.721  
surface error it's like well you   can
  

02:41:18.721   02:41:21.381  
surface error it's like well you   can
just     up     sometimes  

02:41:21.381   02:41:21.391  
just touch up   the paint but sometimes
  

02:41:21.391   02:41:24.201  
just touch up   the paint but sometimes
the     just     rotten  

02:41:24.201   02:41:24.211  
the   rotten
  

02:41:24.211   02:41:29.621  
the   rotten
and    and  

02:41:29.621   02:41:29.631  
and   and
  

02:41:29.631   02:41:32.180  
and   and
then     one     sheer  

02:41:32.180   02:41:32.190  
then so that's one   problems just sheer
  

02:41:32.190   02:41:33.921  
then so that's one   problems just sheer
bloody     with  

02:41:33.921   02:41:33.931  
bloody difficulty and I see this   with
  

02:41:33.931   02:41:35.541  
bloody difficulty and I see this   with 
   a  

02:41:35.541   02:41:35.551  
   they're at a
  

02:41:35.551   02:41:37.850  
   they're at a
point     and  

02:41:37.850   02:41:37.860  
point in   their divorce let's say and
  

02:41:37.860   02:41:40.341  
point in   their divorce let's say and
they     cannot  

02:41:40.341   02:41:40.351  
they don't know what   to do they cannot
  

02:41:40.351   02:41:42.520  
they don't know what   to do they cannot
solve     complicated  

02:41:42.520   02:41:42.530  
solve the problem it's too complicated
 

02:41:42.530   02:41:44.900

02:41:44.910   02:41:46.220  
   resources and
maybe     their  

02:41:46.220   02:41:46.230  
maybe they've squandered some of   their
  

02:41:46.230   02:41:47.841  
maybe they've squandered some of   their
resources    they  

02:41:47.841   02:41:47.851  
resources   as well but sometimes they
  

02:41:47.851   02:41:49.520  
resources   as well but sometimes they 
   then  

02:41:49.520   02:41:49.530  
   and then
  

02:41:49.530   02:41:51.921  
   and then
if     and  

02:41:51.921   02:41:51.931  
if you add to that   error and sin and
  

02:41:51.931   02:41:53.600  
if you add to that   error and sin and
malevolence     those
