00:01:11.970   00:01:15.499  
maybe there's millions of   choices you
know     some  

00:01:15.499   00:01:15.509  
  know and each choice is guided by some
  

00:01:15.509   00:01:18.859  
  know and each choice is guided by some
intuition    or  

00:01:18.859   00:01:18.869  
intuition   of narrative suitability or
  

00:01:18.869   00:01:21.190  
intuition   of narrative suitability or 
   ideal  

00:01:21.190   00:01:21.200  
   or there's some higher ideal
  

00:01:21.200   00:01:23.929  
   or there's some higher ideal
motivating     right     to

motivating it right   the desire to
  

00:01:23.939   00:01:25.700  
motivating it right   the desire to
produce     it  

00:01:25.700   00:01:25.710  
produce a masterpiece maybe that's it
 

00:01:25.710   00:01:27.050  
produce a masterpiece maybe that's it
that     was    the  

00:01:27.050   00:01:27.060  
that was   with the
  

00:01:27.060   00:01:29.179  
that was   with the
Disney     that  

00:01:29.179   00:01:29.189  
Disney movies for example   and so that
  

00:01:29.189   00:01:33.950  
Disney movies for example   and so that 
   the  

00:01:33.950   00:01:33.960  
  that aspiration then then makes the
  

00:01:33.960   00:01:36.609  
  that aspiration then then makes the
decisions     well  

00:01:36.609   00:01:36.619  
decisions   and so I would say well
  

00:01:36.619   00:01:39.350  
decisions   and so I would say well
something     writing  

00:01:39.350   00:01:39.360  
something like that   guided the writing
  

00:01:39.360   00:01:41.810  
something like that   guided the writing
and     in  

00:01:41.810   00:01:41.820  
and   the selection of the stories in in

worked     least  

00:03:04.009   00:03:04.019  
  worked out quite nicely for me at least
  

00:03:04.019   00:03:05.750  
  worked out quite nicely for me at least
as     as     I  

00:03:05.750   00:03:05.760  
as far   once I
  

00:03:05.760   00:03:07.400  
as far   once I
have     structure  

00:03:07.400   00:03:07.410  
have the basic archetypal structure
 

00:03:07.410   00:03:08.960  
have the basic archetypal structure
mapped     opened    of

different   cultures and that's been
unbelievably    the  

00:03:14.420   00:03:14.430  
unbelievably   useful like the
  

00:03:14.430   00:03:16.670

00:03:31.980   00:03:34.430  
the daodejing is also very powerful   so I
think     on  

00:03:34.430   00:03:34.440  
think that things can be   different on
  

00:03:34.440   00:03:36.530  
think that things can be   different on
one     but  

00:03:36.530   00:03:36.540  
one level   and the same at another but
  

00:03:36.540   00:03:38.569  
one level   and the same at another but 
   on  

00:03:38.569   00:03:38.579  
  that humanity kind of coalesce is on
  

00:03:38.579   00:03:41.390  
  that humanity kind of coalesce is on
what's     period  

00:03:41.390   00:03:41.400  
what's the same over a   reasonable period
  

00:03:41.400   00:03:43.039  
what's the same over a   reasonable period
of     time     many  

00:03:43.039   00:03:43.049  
of time   isn't that many
  

00:03:43.049   00:03:45.289  
of time   isn't that many 
   properly  

00:03:45.289   00:03:45.299  
  ways that human beings can live properly
  

00:03:45.299   00:03:48.349  
  ways that human beings can live properly 
   together  

00:03:48.349   00:03:48.359  
  as individuals and as groups together
  

00:03:48.359   00:03:51.410  
  as individuals and as groups together 
   that  

00:03:51.410   00:03:51.420  
  and so there's this constant force that
  

00:03:51.420   00:03:53.690  
  and so there's this constant force that
makes    presuppositions  

00:03:53.690   00:03:53.700  
makes   our ethical presuppositions
  

00:03:53.700   00:03:55.849  
makes   our ethical presuppositions
converge     automatically  

00:03:55.849   00:03:55.859  
converge and then that's automatically
 

00:03:55.859   00:03:58.430  
converge and then that's automatically
expressed     stories    something  

00:03:58.430   00:03:58.440  
expressed in the stories   it's something
  

00:03:58.440   00:04:00.500  
expressed in the stories   it's something 
   process  

00:04:00.500   00:04:00.510  
   process
  

00:04:00.510   00:04:10.729  
   process
and     error     so  

00:04:10.729   00:04:10.739  
 
 

00:04:10.739   00:04:15.690  
 
so     announcement    two  

00:04:15.690   00:04:15.700
