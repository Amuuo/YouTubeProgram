true   they
weren't     little     wrong  

00:08:56.810   00:08:56.820  
   wrong
  

00:08:56.820   00:08:59.030

and not wrong in some arbitrary   way they
  

00:08:59.040   00:09:00.620  
and not wrong in some arbitrary   way they
were     game     beings  

00:09:00.620   00:09:00.630  
were playing   that human beings

murderous catastrophe and there's
 

00:09:06.240   00:09:07.759  
murderous catastrophe and there's
something   the  

00:09:07.759   00:09:07.769  
something   in the

anyways     all     and  

00:10:18.890   00:10:18.900  
anyways I worked all   and
  

00:10:18.900   00:10:20.960  
anyways I worked all   and
then     taught     courses  

00:10:20.960   00:10:20.970  
then I   courses
  

00:10:20.970   00:10:22.640  
then I   courses
that     on     the  

00:10:22.640   00:10:22.650  
   the ideas and the
  

00:10:22.650   00:10:25.370  
   the ideas and the
courses     say  

00:10:25.370   00:10:25.380  
courses were very impactful I would say
 

00:10:25.380   00:10:26.840  
courses were very impactful I would say
they     had    people  

00:10:26.840   00:10:26.850  
they had   people
  

00:10:26.850   00:10:29.329  
they had   people
that     was     through

let's   sort of
sociological     that

sociological agreement I   would say that
you     right  

00:20:30.200   00:20:30.210  
you can   identify the radical right
  

00:20:30.210   00:20:32.450  
you can   identify the radical right

   I thought 
   case  

00:28:28.640   00:28:28.650  
  okay well let's assume the worst case
  

00:28:28.650   00:28:30.770  
  okay well let's assume the worst case 
   scenario  

00:28:30.770   00:28:30.780  
  scenario in the worst case scenario
  

00:28:30.780   00:28:32.480  
  scenario in the worst case scenario
would     be     me  

00:28:32.480   00:28:32.490  
would be   that a student would report me
  

00:28:32.490   00:28:34.159  
would be   that a student would report me

to   the Ontario Human Rights Commission
and     investigation  

00:28:35.659   00:28:35.669  
and   then they would do an investigation
  

00:28:35.669   00:28:37.520  
and   then they would do an investigation 
   because  

00:28:37.520   00:28:37.530  
  and they would find me guilty because
  

00:28:37.530   00:28:39.289  
  and they would find me guilty because 
   Commission

finds 99% of the people   brought to it
  

00:28:42.450   00:28:44.990  
finds 99% of the people   brought to it
guilty     because     totalitarians

00:28:45.000   00:28:47.450  
guilty   that's what totalitarians
do     to     the

reeducation they would put   me through
  

00:28:51.030   00:28:52.760  
reeducation they would put   me through

a bigger threat   country it's not
  

00:48:52.920   00:48:55.520  
a bigger threat   country it's not
so    you  

00:48:55.520   00:48:55.530  
so   because you
  

00:48:55.530   00:48:57.530  
so   because you

00:48:57.530   00:48:57.540  
guys   you're your political landscape is
  

00:48:57.540   00:48:59.900  
guys   you're your political landscape is
more     ours  

00:48:59.900   00:48:59.910  
more   balanced I would say than ours
  

00:48:59.910   00:49:01.850  
more   balanced I would say than ours
if     to  

00:49:01.850   00:49:01.860  
if the radical right posed a threat to
 

00:49:01.860   00:49:04.700  
if the radical right posed a threat to
   do  

00:49:04.700   00:49:04.710  
   Academy which they most decidedly do
  

00:49:04.710   00:49:06.920  
   Academy which they most decidedly do
not     I     about  

00:49:06.920   00:49:06.930  
not then I   upset about
  

00:49:06.930   00:49:11.150  
not then I   upset about
that    part  

00:49:11.150   00:49:11.160  
that   and so I think again it's it's part
  

00:49:11.160   00:49:13.460  
that   and so I think again it's it's part 
   failure  

00:49:13.460   00:49:13.470  
   of the radical left failure
  

00:49:13.470   00:49:15.470  
   of the radical left failure
to     the     failure  

00:49:15.470   00:49:15.480  
to take or the   left's in general failure
  

00:49:15.480   00:49:17.390  
to take or the   left's in general failure
to     radicals  

00:49:17.390   00:49:17.400  
to take responsibility for the radicals
 

00:49:17.400   00:49:18.560

it's a very dismal literature   because
  

00:55:46.000   00:55:48.480  
it's a very dismal literature   because
you     aggressive  

00:55:48.480   00:55:48.490  
you see these early onset   aggressive
  

00:55:48.490   00:55:52.320  
you see these early onset   aggressive
kids     persistent     then

kids   and then
  

00:55:52.330   00:55:53.760  
kids   and then
you     at     literature  

00:55:53.760   00:55:53.770  
you look at   the intervention literature
  

00:55:53.770   00:55:56.490  
you look at   the intervention literature
and     your     no

and that's   all there is to it that's
  

00:56:44.079   00:56:46.770  
and that's   all there is to it that's
that's     some  

00:56:46.770   00:56:46.780  
that's what we've got   now there's some
  

00:56:46.780   00:56:48.150  
that's what we've got   now there's some
downside     that     a  

00:56:48.150   00:56:48.160  
downside to that   because there's a
  

00:56:48.160   00:56:49.859  
downside to that   because there's a
corollary     that  

00:56:49.859   00:56:49.869  
corollary literature that suggests   that
  

00:56:49.869   00:56:51.270  
corollary literature that suggests   that
the     worst     with

the worst   thing that you can do with
  

00:56:51.280   00:56:52.829  
the worst   thing that you can do with
antisocial     people     them  

00:56:52.829   00:56:52.839  
antisocial people   is to group them
  

00:56:52.839   00:56:55.109  
antisocial people   is to group them
together    prisons  

00:56:55.109   00:56:55.119  
together   which is what we do in prisons
  

00:56:55.119   00:56:58.710  
together   which is what we do in prisons 
   of  

00:56:58.710   00:56:58.720  
  so so that's a whole mess anyways one of
  

00:56:58.720   00:57:00.120  
  so so that's a whole mess anyways one of
the     doing     to  

00:57:00.120   00:57:00.130  
the things we were doing   to
  

00:57:00.130   00:57:01.640  
the things we were doing   to
see     there     cognitive

see   might be cognitive
  

00:57:01.650   00:57:04.290  
see   might be cognitive
predictors     so  

00:57:04.290   00:57:04.300  
predictors of   antisocial behavior and so

   well  

00:57:34.800   00:57:34.810  
  when I got to Harvard I thought well
  

00:57:34.810   00:57:37.290  
  when I got to Harvard I thought well
that's     the  

00:57:37.290   00:57:37.300  
that's interesting   we could use the
  

00:57:37.300   00:57:40.109  
that's interesting   we could use the
neuro     negative  

00:57:40.109   00:57:40.119  
neuro psych battery to predict negative
 

00:57:40.119   00:57:42.809  
neuro psych battery to predict negative
behavior   to  

00:57:42.809   00:57:42.819  
behavior   we could use it to
  

00:57:42.819   00:57:44.910  
behavior   we could use it to 
   thought  

00:57:44.910   00:57:44.920  
   positive behavior so I thought
  

00:57:44.920   00:57:46.620  
   positive behavior so I thought
well    psych  

00:57:46.620   00:57:46.630  
well   what if we turned the neuro psych
  

00:57:46.630   00:57:49.890  
well   what if we turned the neuro psych
battery     we  

00:57:49.890   00:57:49.900  
battery and over and thought well can we
 

00:57:49.900   00:57:51.900  
battery and over and thought well can we
   you  

00:57:51.900   00:57:51.910  
  predict grades for example because you
  

00:57:51.910   00:57:53.670  
  predict grades for example because you 
   so  

00:57:53.670   00:57:53.680  
   decent thing to predict so
  

00:57:53.680   00:57:56.550  
   decent thing to predict so
we     study     that  

00:57:56.550   00:57:56.560  
we ran a study   we ran a study that

then the IQ claims are correct because
 

01:01:46.069   01:01:48.160  
then the IQ claims are correct because
the     psychometrically 

01:01:48.160   01:01:48.170  
the IQ claims are more psychometrically
 

01:01:48.170   01:01:50.530  
the IQ claims are more psychometrically
rigorous     phenomena 

01:01:50.530   01:01:50.540  
rigorous than any other phenomena
 

01:01:50.540   01:01:52.569  
rigorous than any other phenomena
phenomenon     been    by  

01:01:52.569   01:01:52.579  
phenomenon that's been   discovered by
  

01:01:52.579   01:01:55.240  
phenomenon that's been   discovered by
social     literature  

01:01:55.240   01:01:55.250  
social scientists   now the IQ literature
  

01:01:55.250   01:01:57.520  
social scientists   now the IQ literature
is     it  

01:01:57.520   01:01:57.530  
is a dismal literature no one likes it
 

01:01:57.530   01:02:00.069  
is a dismal literature no one likes it
   a  

01:02:00.069   01:02:00.079  
   so here's a
  

01:02:00.079   01:02:02.470  
   so here's a
little     fun     you  

01:02:02.470   01:02:02.480  
little   little fact for you
  

01:02:02.480   01:02:04.359  
little   little fact for you 
   alike  

01:02:04.359   01:02:04.369  
  for liberals and conservatives alike
  

01:02:04.369   01:02:05.799  
  for liberals and conservatives alike 
   a  

01:02:05.799   01:02:05.809  
  because conservatives think there's a
  

01:02:05.809   01:02:07.480  
  because conservatives think there's a
job     off  

01:02:07.480   01:02:07.490  
job   for everyone if people just get off
  

01:02:07.490   01:02:09.579  
job   for everyone if people just get off
their     asses     liberals

their asses   get to work and liberals
  

01:02:09.589   01:02:11.140  
their asses   get to work and liberals
think     do  

01:02:11.140   01:02:11.150  
think   while you can train anyone to do
  

01:02:11.150   01:02:13.630  
think   while you can train anyone to do 
   job  

01:02:13.630   01:02:13.640  
   a job
  

01:02:13.640   01:02:16.059  
   a job
for    train  

01:02:16.059   01:02:16.069  
for   you can't train
  

01:02:16.069   01:02:18.069  
for   you can't train
everyone     wrong  

01:02:18.069   01:02:18.079  
everyone   to do everything that's wrong
  

01:02:18.079   01:02:20.410  
everyone   to do everything that's wrong
and     one     of  

01:02:20.410   01:02:20.420  
and here's one   of the consequences of
  

01:02:20.420   01:02:22.750  
and here's one   of the consequences of
that    Forces  

01:02:22.750   01:02:22.760  
that   so as I mentioned the Armed Forces
  

01:02:22.760   01:02:24.970  
that   so as I mentioned the Armed Forces
has     lot     they  

01:02:24.970   01:02:24.980  
has done a lot   on IQ and they
  

01:02:24.980   01:02:27.640  
has done a lot   on IQ and they
started     back     they  

01:02:27.640   01:02:27.650  
started back   the reason they
  

01:02:27.650   01:02:30.010  
started back   the reason they
did     that     obvious  

01:02:30.010   01:02:30.020  
did that   was because well for obvious
  

01:02:30.020   01:02:32.349  
did that   was because well for obvious
reasons     war     and  

01:02:32.349   01:02:32.359  
   and
  

01:02:32.359   01:02:35.079  
   and 
   into  

01:02:35.079   01:02:35.089  
   people into
  

01:02:35.089   01:02:36.760  
   people into
the    as  

01:02:36.760   01:02:36.770  
the   officer positions as rapidly as
  

01:02:36.770   01:02:39.309  
the   officer positions as rapidly as 
   a  

01:02:39.309   01:02:39.319  
   or you'll lose so that's a
  

01:02:39.319   01:02:42.160  
   or you'll lose so that's a
reason     has  

01:02:42.160   01:02:42.170  
reason and now the   Armed Forces has
  

01:02:42.170   01:02:45.640  
reason and now the   Armed Forces has
experimented    and  

01:02:45.640   01:02:45.650  
experimented   since 1919 and
  

01:02:45.650   01:02:49.630  
experimented   since 1919 and
in     last     as  

01:02:49.630   01:02:49.640  
in the last   was passed as
  

01:02:49.640   01:02:51.670  
in the last   was passed as
a     was  

01:02:51.670   01:02:51.680  
a consequence of that analysis which was
 

01:02:51.680   01:02:53.620  
a consequence of that analysis which was
   anyone  

01:02:53.620   01:02:53.630  
  that it was illegal to induct anyone
  

01:02:53.630   01:02:55.420  
  that it was illegal to induct anyone
into     IQ     of  

01:02:55.420   01:02:55.430  
into the Armed Forces who had an IQ   of
  

01:02:55.430   01:02:59.470  
into the Armed Forces who had an IQ   of
less     and  

01:02:59.470   01:02:59.480  
  less than 83 now the question is why and
  

01:02:59.480   01:03:02.710  
  less than 83 now the question is why and
the     in  

01:03:02.710   01:03:02.720  
the answer was all of that effort put in
 

01:03:02.720   01:03:04.510  
the answer was all of that effort put in
by   if  

01:03:04.510   01:03:04.520  
by   the armed forces indicated that if
  

01:03:04.520   01:03:06.490  
by   the armed forces indicated that if
you     wasn't  

01:03:06.490   01:03:06.500  
you had an IQ   of 83 or less there wasn't
  

01:03:06.500   01:03:08.020  
you had an IQ   of 83 or less there wasn't
anything     do  

01:03:08.020   01:03:08.030  
anything that   you could be trained to do
  

01:03:08.030   01:03:09.849  
anything that   you could be trained to do
in     the     positively  

01:03:09.849   01:03:09.859  
in the   military that wasn't positively
  

01:03:09.859   01:03:12.039  
in the   military that wasn't positively
counterproductive     to     think  

01:03:12.039   01:03:12.049  
counterproductive   think
  

01:03:12.049   01:03:14.589  
counterproductive   think 
   is  

01:03:14.589   01:03:14.599  
   a because the military is
  

01:03:14.599   01:03:17.380  
   a because the military is 
   right  

01:03:17.380   01:03:17.390  
  chronically desperate for people right
  

01:03:17.390   01:03:18.730  
  chronically desperate for people right
it's     like     like  

01:03:18.730   01:03:18.740  
it's not like   it's not like
  

01:03:18.740   01:03:20.680  
it's not like   it's not like
people     up     inducted  

01:03:20.680   01:03:20.690  
people   inducted
  

01:03:20.690   01:03:22.690  
people   inducted
right     go     recruit  

01:03:22.690   01:03:22.700  
right they have to go   out and recruit
  

01:03:22.700   01:03:24.430  
right they have to go   out and recruit
and     and     they're  

01:03:24.430   01:03:24.440  
and it's not easy and   so they're
  

01:03:24.440   01:03:25.930  
and it's not easy and   so they're
desperate    every  

01:03:25.930   01:03:25.940  
desperate   on every
  

01:03:25.940   01:03:28.420  
desperate   on every
body     can     then  

01:03:28.420   01:03:28.430  
body they can   possibly manage and then
  

01:03:28.430   01:03:30.940  
body they can   possibly manage and then
especially    in  

01:03:30.940   01:03:30.950  
especially   wartime but also in
  

01:03:30.950   01:03:31.930  
especially   wartime but also in
peacetime     another  

01:03:31.930   01:03:31.940  
peacetime   but then there was another
  

01:03:31.940   01:03:33.940  
peacetime   but then there was another 
   was  

01:03:33.940   01:03:33.950  
  reason to which was the Armed Forces was
  

01:03:33.950   01:03:36.550  
  reason to which was the Armed Forces was
also     policy     to  

01:03:36.550   01:03:36.560  
also set up from a policy   perspective to
  

01:03:36.560   01:03:39.250  
also set up from a policy   perspective to
take     say  

01:03:39.250   01:03:39.260  
take people in the underclass let's say
 

01:03:39.260   01:03:41.380  
take people in the underclass let's say
and     them    least  

01:03:41.380   01:03:41.390  
and train them and move them   up at least
  

01:03:41.390   01:03:42.970  
and train them and move them   up at least
into     maybe     the  

01:03:42.970   01:03:42.980  
into   the
  

01:03:42.980   01:03:44.740  
into   the 
   element  

01:03:44.740   01:03:44.750  
  middle class so there's a policy element
  

01:03:44.750   01:03:46.240  
  middle class so there's a policy element
to     too     that  

01:03:46.240   01:03:46.250  
to it too   and so even from that
  

01:03:46.250   01:03:47.890  
to it too   and so even from that 
   the  

01:03:47.890   01:03:47.900  
   could see that the
  

01:03:47.900   01:03:50.080  
   could see that the
military     in  

01:03:50.080   01:03:50.090  
military is desperate to   bring people in
  

01:03:50.090   01:03:53.260  
military is desperate to   bring people in
but    it's  

01:03:53.260   01:03:53.270  
   well with an IQ of 83 or less it's
  

01:03:53.270   01:03:56.050  
   well with an IQ of 83 or less it's
not     people  

01:03:56.050   01:03:56.060  
not happening   okay so how many people
  

01:03:56.060   01:04:02.590  
not happening   okay so how many people 
   now  

01:04:02.590   01:04:02.600  
   of 83 or less 10 percent now
  

01:04:02.600   01:04:07.450  
   of 83 or less 10 percent now
if     that     you  

01:04:07.450   01:04:07.460  
if that   doesn't if that doesn't hurt you
  

01:04:07.460   01:04:10.110  
if that   doesn't if that doesn't hurt you 
   properly  

01:04:10.110   01:04:10.120  
   it properly
  

01:04:10.120   01:04:13.300  
   it properly 
   a  

01:04:13.300   01:04:13.310  
   in a
  

01:04:13.310   01:04:15.580  
   in a
complex     that's  

01:04:15.580   01:04:15.590  
complex society   like ours and one that's
  

01:04:15.590   01:04:17.620  
complex society   like ours and one that's
becoming    there  

01:04:17.620   01:04:17.630  
becoming   there
  

01:04:17.630   01:04:19.990  
becoming   there
isn't     for     the  

01:04:19.990   01:04:20.000  
isn't anything for   10 percent of the
  

01:04:20.000   01:04:23.320  
isn't anything for   10 percent of the
population    are  

01:04:23.320   01:04:23.330  
population   well what are
  

01:04:23.330   01:04:24.610  
population   well what are
we     that  

01:04:24.610   01:04:24.620  
we gonna do we're gonna ignore   that

we gonna do we're gonna ignore   that
we're     from     and  

01:04:26.770   01:04:26.780  
we're gonna run away from   that and
  

01:04:26.780   01:04:29.050  
we're gonna run away from   that and 
   or  

01:04:29.050   01:04:29.060  
  believe me we have every reason to or
  

01:04:29.060   01:04:30.850  
  believe me we have every reason to or
we're     that  

01:04:30.850   01:04:30.860  
we're gonna contend with the   fact that
  

01:04:30.860   01:04:33.760  
we're gonna contend with the   fact that
we     need     it

   uh with IQ forthrightly it's
like     find     that

   we have
well     case     places

well it's also the case   that in places
like     were  

01:05:50.380   01:05:50.390  
like Great Britain   when IQ tests were

but that's not a   answer so I
wrote     week     said  

01:07:47.630   01:07:47.640  
wrote a blog   and I said
  

01:07:47.640   01:07:49.430  
wrote a blog   and I said

failed     that     why  

01:08:23.510   01:08:23.520  
   well why
  

01:08:23.520   01:08:25.940  
   well why
does     occur  

01:08:25.940   01:08:25.950  
does   this over representation occur
  

01:08:25.950   01:08:28.729  
does   this over representation occur
because    also  

01:08:28.729   01:08:28.739  
because   it does it also there's also
  

01:08:28.739   01:08:31.130  
because   it does it also there's also
over     political

01:08:34.910   01:08:34.920  
movements   okay why
  

01:08:34.920   01:08:38.720  
movements   okay why
well     answer     okay  

01:08:38.720   01:08:38.730  
well answer   okay
  

01:08:38.730   01:08:41.030  
well answer   okay
that's     very     had  

01:08:41.030   01:08:41.040  
that's not a very   we've had
  

01:08:41.040   01:08:43.729  
that's not a very   we've had
we've     all     right  

01:08:43.729   01:08:43.739  
we've used that answer before   right
  

01:08:43.739   01:08:46.220  
we've used that answer before   right
but     but     well  

01:08:46.220   01:08:46.230  
but but   do we have an alternative well
  

01:08:46.230   01:08:48.860  
but but   do we have an alternative well
here's     alternative     average

  which is about one standard deviation 
   what  

01:08:57.349   01:08:57.359  
  above the population average and so what

  above the population average and so what 
   Ashkenazi  

01:08:59.890   01:08:59.900  
   means is that the average Ashkenazi
  

01:08:59.900   01:09:03.170  
   means is that the average Ashkenazi 
   higher

01:09:28.340   01:09:28.350  
are important   of where we
  

01:09:28.350   01:09:31.340  
are important   of where we

the same thing   most engineers are male
why     interested     in  

01:09:42.380   01:09:42.390  
why because men   in
  

01:09:42.390   01:09:44.570  
why because men   in
things     are     in  

01:09:44.570   01:09:44.580  
things   more interested in
  

01:09:44.580   01:09:46.390  
things   more interested in
people     you     that's  

01:09:46.390   01:09:46.400  
people   might say well that's
  

01:09:46.400   01:09:49.460  
people   might say well that's
socio-cultural     it's     and  

01:09:49.460   01:09:49.470  
socio-cultural it's like no it's   not and
  

01:09:49.470   01:09:52.070  
socio-cultural it's like no it's   not and
we     know     up

you     that

you might ask how   much and answer that

took a   random man and around and woman
  

01:10:56.550   01:10:59.089  
took a   random man and around and woman
out    bet  

01:10:59.089   01:10:59.099  
out   and you had to bet
  

01:10:59.099   01:11:01.040  
out   and you had to bet
on     aggressive     bet  

01:11:01.040   01:11:01.050  
on who was more aggressive   you bet
  

01:11:01.050   01:11:02.990  
on who was more aggressive   you bet
on     right     of  

01:11:02.990   01:11:03.000  
on   60 percent of
  

01:11:03.000   01:11:05.209  
on   60 percent of
the     not     right  

01:11:05.209   01:11:05.219  
the   that much right
  

01:11:05.219   01:11:07.459  
the   that much right
it's     but     it's  

01:11:07.459   01:11:07.469  
it's   it's
  

01:11:07.469   01:11:12.080  
it's   it's
not     like     so  

01:11:12.080   01:11:12.090  
not like   it's 60/40 okay so
  

01:11:12.090   01:11:14.750  
not like   it's 60/40 okay so
so     what     a  

01:11:14.750   01:11:14.760  
   well we got a
  

01:11:14.760   01:11:16.640  
   well we got a
tail     that  

01:11:16.640   01:11:16.650  
tail problem here again let's say that
 

01:11:16.650   01:11:18.500  
tail problem here again let's say that
now   the  

01:11:18.500   01:11:18.510  
now   the
  

01:11:18.510   01:11:20.419  
now   the
extremes     identify  

01:11:20.419   01:11:20.429  
extremes of aggression and you   identify
  

01:11:20.429   01:11:22.939  
extremes of aggression and you   identify
the     hundred  

01:11:22.939   01:11:22.949  
the most aggressive   one in a hundred
  

01:11:22.949   01:11:27.620  
the most aggressive   one in a hundred
persons    in  

01:11:27.620   01:11:27.630  
persons   in

prison   those people that's why most of
  

01:11:31.559   01:11:34.549  
prison   those people that's why most of
the    this  

01:11:34.549   01:11:34.559  
   people in prison are men and so this
  

01:11:34.559   01:11:37.100  
   people in prison are men and so this
is     our

01:27:03.560   01:27:03.570  
analysis   that
  

01:27:03.570   01:27:05.629  
analysis   that
pulls     IQ     a

pulls out   from a
  

01:27:05.639   01:27:07.100  
pulls out   from a
group     example     the  

01:27:07.100   01:27:07.110  
group   it's the
  

01:27:07.110   01:27:08.509  
group   it's the
same     thing     Five  

01:27:08.509   01:27:08.519  
same thing   that produced the Big Five

analysis     if  

01:27:14.180   01:27:14.190  
analysis does is   tell you which quest if

analysis does is   tell you which quest if
questions     together     say  

01:27:17.330   01:27:17.340  
questions group together   so let's say
  

01:27:17.340   01:27:20.060  
questions group together   so let's say
you     have  

01:27:20.060   01:27:20.070  
you have opinion a well if you have
 

01:27:20.070   01:27:21.560  
you have opinion a well if you have
opinion     a    you  

01:27:21.560   01:27:21.570  
opinion a if there's a   hundred of you
  

01:27:21.570   01:27:23.239  
opinion a if there's a   hundred of you
everyone     has  

01:27:23.239   01:27:23.249  
everyone who has opinion a also has
 

01:27:23.249   01:27:26.419  
everyone who has opinion a also has
opinion   the  

01:27:26.419   01:27:26.429  
opinion   B an opinion C and if that's the
  

01:27:26.429   01:27:28.310  
opinion   B an opinion C and if that's the 
   there's  

01:27:28.310   01:27:28.320  
   there's
  

01:27:28.320   01:27:30.680  
   there's
something     same     now  

01:27:30.680   01:27:30.690  
something   now
  

01:27:30.690   01:27:32.509  
something   now
what     when  

01:27:32.509   01:27:32.519  
what we could   have found was that when
  

01:27:32.519   01:27:34.520  
what we could   have found was that when 
   there  

01:27:34.520   01:27:34.530  
  we analyzed these 400 questions there
  

01:27:34.530   01:27:37.279  
  we analyzed these 400 questions there
was     would  

01:27:37.279   01:27:37.289  
was   like 50 clumps and so that would
  

01:27:37.289   01:27:39.500  
was   like 50 clumps and so that would
have     thing     as  

01:27:39.500   01:27:39.510  
have blown there's such a thing   as
  

01:27:39.510   01:27:41.540  
have blown there's such a thing   as 
   of  

01:27:41.540   01:27:41.550  
   correctness hypothesis out of
  

01:27:41.550   01:27:42.109  
   correctness hypothesis out of
the     water  

01:27:42.109   01:27:42.119  
the water
 

01:27:42.119   01:27:43.399  
the water
but   found  

01:27:43.399   01:27:43.409  
but   that isn't what happened we found
  

01:27:43.409   01:27:45.620  
but   that isn't what happened we found 
   like  

01:27:45.620   01:27:45.630  
   one of which looked like
  

01:27:45.630   01:27:48.140  
   one of which looked like 
   the  

01:27:48.140   01:27:48.150  
  something like moderate leftism and the
  

01:27:48.150   01:27:49.660  
  something like moderate leftism and the
other     very     like  

01:27:49.660   01:27:49.670  
other that looked very   much like
  

01:27:49.670   01:27:51.890  
other that looked very   much like
totalitarian    and  

01:27:51.890   01:27:51.900  
totalitarian   political correctness and
  

01:27:51.900   01:27:54.919  
totalitarian   political correctness and
it     and  

01:27:54.919   01:27:54.929  
it was very   very robust finding and and
  

01:27:54.929   01:27:57.410  
it was very   very robust finding and and
we     this  

01:27:57.410   01:27:57.420  
we replicated   it as well she did this
  

01:27:57.420   01:28:00.140  
we replicated   it as well she did this 
   and  

01:28:00.140   01:28:00.150  
   and
  

01:28:00.150   01:28:02.689  
   and
then     these  

01:28:02.689   01:28:02.699  
then we looked at what predicted   these
  

01:28:02.699   01:28:04.729  
then we looked at what predicted   these
beliefs     the  

01:28:04.729   01:28:04.739  
beliefs   first of all that the
  

01:28:04.739   01:28:06.890  
beliefs   first of all that the
correlation     leftist  

01:28:06.890   01:28:06.900  
correlation between   the moderate leftist
  

01:28:06.900   01:28:08.870  
correlation between   the moderate leftist
clump     radical  

01:28:08.870   01:28:08.880  
clump of questions and the radical
 

01:28:08.880   01:28:10.189  
clump of questions and the radical
leftist     questions    actually  

01:28:10.189   01:28:10.199  
leftist clump of questions   actually
  

01:28:10.199   01:28:12.350  
leftist clump of questions   actually
wasn't     so     the  

01:28:12.350   01:28:12.360  
   the
  

01:28:12.360   01:28:14.239  
   the
things     there's  

01:28:14.239   01:28:14.249  
things that we surmise is that there's
 

01:28:14.249   01:28:16.009  
things that we surmise is that there's
an     actual    between  

01:28:16.009   01:28:16.019  
an actual   left between
  

01:28:16.019   01:28:17.629  
an actual   left between 
   and  

01:28:17.629   01:28:17.639  
   and the radicals and
  

01:28:17.639   01:28:20.479  
   and the radicals and
that's     out     I  

01:28:20.479   01:28:20.489  
that's just not played itself out   and I
  

01:28:20.489   01:28:21.620  
that's just not played itself out   and I 
   that  

01:28:21.620   01:28:21.630  
   actually see that
  

01:28:21.630   01:28:22.280  
   actually see that
happening 

01:28:22.280   01:28:22.290  
happening
 

01:28:22.290   01:28:24.200  
happening
the     proclivity    leftists  

01:28:24.200   01:28:24.210  
the proclivity   of the radical leftists
  

01:28:24.210   01:28:26.780  
the proclivity   of the radical leftists
to     right     which  

01:28:26.780   01:28:26.790  
to devour themselves right   so which

happens   on a very regular basis or 
   proclivity  

01:28:31.640   01:28:31.650  
   you can see it in the proclivity
  

01:28:31.650   01:28:33.620  
   you can see it in the proclivity 
   the  

01:28:33.620   01:28:33.630  
   after the

radicals   whatever so there's two clumps
  

01:28:38.250   01:28:40.880  
radicals   whatever so there's two clumps
to     political     them  

01:28:40.880   01:28:40.890  
   both of them
  

01:28:40.890   01:28:42.790  
   both of them
were     agreeableness  

01:28:42.790   01:28:42.800  
were predicted by   trade agreeableness
  

01:28:42.800   01:28:45.200  
were predicted by   trade agreeableness

  by also by being female which was a real
shock     to     let's  

01:28:54.650   01:28:54.660  
shock to   most of the so let's
  

01:28:54.660   01:28:56.360  
shock to   most of the so let's
say     with  

01:28:56.360   01:28:56.370  
say females and males differ with
 

01:28:56.370   01:28:57.860  
say females and males differ with
regards   to  

01:28:57.860   01:28:57.870  
regards   to some outcome you try to
  

01:28:57.870   01:29:00.170  
regards   to some outcome you try to
figure     out     just  

01:29:00.170   01:29:00.180  
figure out   just
  

01:29:00.180   01:29:01.400  
figure out   just 
   all  

01:29:01.400   01:29:01.410  
   female but there's all
  

01:29:01.410   01:29:02.960  
   female but there's all
sorts     associated     being  

01:29:02.960   01:29:02.970  
sorts of things   with being

  female or male that are like 
   found  

01:29:07.190   01:29:07.200  
   we found
  

01:29:07.200   01:29:09.110  
   we found
almost     personality  

01:29:09.110   01:29:09.120  
almost invariably with the personality
 

01:29:09.120   01:29:10.640  
almost invariably with the personality
literature's     at    differences  

01:29:10.640   01:29:10.650  
literature's if you look at   differences
  

01:29:10.650   01:29:12.260  
literature's if you look at   differences
between     you  

01:29:12.260   01:29:12.270  
between men and women   and then you
  

01:29:12.270   01:29:14.630  
between men and women   and then you
control     differences  

01:29:14.630   01:29:14.640  
control   for personality the differences
  

01:29:14.640   01:29:16.460  
control   for personality the differences
go     differences  

01:29:16.460   01:29:16.470  
go away   so they're not differences
  

01:29:16.470   01:29:18.050  
go away   so they're not differences
between     they're  

01:29:18.050   01:29:18.060  
between men and women per se they're
 

01:29:18.060   01:29:20.450  
between men and women per se they're
differences     personality    with  

01:29:20.450   01:29:20.460  
differences between personality   but with
  

01:29:20.460   01:29:21.920  
differences between personality   but with
political     correctness     an  

01:29:21.920   01:29:21.930  
political correctness   we found an
  

01:29:21.930   01:29:23.780  
political correctness   we found an 
   pure  

01:29:23.780   01:29:23.790  
   agreeableness which was a pure
  

01:29:23.790   01:29:25.610  
   agreeableness which was a pure
personality     of  

01:29:25.610   01:29:25.620  
personality effect and an effect of
 

01:29:25.620   01:29:27.800  
personality effect and an effect of
being   a  

01:29:27.800   01:29:27.810  
being   female so we also found a
  

01:29:27.810   01:29:29.660  
being   female so we also found a
pronounced     effect     at  

01:29:29.660   01:29:29.670  
pronounced effect   of having taken at
  

01:29:29.670   01:29:32.420  
pronounced effect   of having taken at
least     politically  

01:29:32.420   01:29:32.430  
least one seminar   that was politically
  

01:29:32.430   01:29:34.250  
least one seminar   that was politically
correct     a  

01:29:34.250   01:29:34.260  
correct in its orientation   so that had a
  

01:29:34.260   01:29:37.370  
correct in its orientation   so that had a
walloping     effect     to  

01:29:37.370   01:29:37.380  
walloping effect   so there does seem to
  

01:29:37.380   01:29:39.650  
walloping effect   so there does seem to 
   according  

01:29:39.650   01:29:39.660  
  be something about political according
  

01:29:39.660   01:29:42.880  
  be something about political according
to     which     I  

01:29:42.880   01:29:42.890  
to that research which   you know it's I
  

01:29:42.890   01:29:45.860  
to that research which   you know it's I
try     none  

01:29:45.860   01:29:45.870  
try to rely on better research but none
 

01:29:45.870   01:29:48.320  
try to rely on better research but none
has     been    I  

01:29:48.320   01:29:48.330  
has been   done so that's the best that I
  

01:29:48.330   01:29:50.360  
has been   done so that's the best that I
thought     this  

01:29:50.360   01:29:50.370  
thought   and and the woman who did this
  

01:29:50.370   01:29:52.250  
thought   and and the woman who did this
research     the  

01:29:52.250   01:29:52.260  
research is very very smart   and the
  

01:29:52.260   01:29:53.840  
research is very very smart   and the
study     it's  

01:29:53.840   01:29:53.850  
study was   well done so I think it's
  

01:29:53.850   01:29:56.870  
study was   well done so I think it's
credible     that's  

01:29:56.870   01:29:56.880  
credible so and one of the things that's
 

01:29:56.880   01:29:58.640  
credible so and one of the things that's

01:30:06.240   01:30:08.120  
was Freud's I think signal contribution
to     psychopathology    most  

01:30:08.120   01:30:08.130  
to psychopathology   you know for most

to psychopathology   you know for most
most     who  

01:30:10.370   01:30:10.380  
most of Freud's clients were people who
 

01:30:10.380   01:30:11.990  
most of Freud's clients were people who
were     struggling    the  

01:30:11.990   01:30:12.000  
were struggling   to get out of the

were struggling   to get out of the

clutches of their family right and part
 

01:30:14.850   01:30:16.340  
clutches of their family right and part
of     are    very  

01:30:16.340   01:30:16.350  
of that is human beings are   very
  

01:30:16.350   01:30:18.590  
of that is human beings are   very

01:30:18.590   01:30:18.600  
dependent   right because well because we
  

01:30:18.600   01:30:20.390

have     of  

01:30:20.390   01:30:20.400  
have this incredibly long period of
 

01:30:20.400   01:30:23.360  
have this incredibly long period of

01:30:23.360   01:30:23.370  
   30 years maybe but certainly
  

01:30:23.370   01:30:27.050  
   30 years maybe but certainly
18     struggle     up  

01:30:27.050   01:30:27.060  
18 years and so it's hard to struggle   up
  

01:30:27.060   01:30:30.290  
18 years and so it's hard to struggle   up
from     an

you     clinician  

01:30:33.650   01:30:33.660  
you   see this and if you're a clinician
  

01:30:33.660   01:30:35.240  
you   see this and if you're a clinician 
   so  

01:30:35.240   01:30:35.250  
   people are so
  

01:30:35.250   01:30:36.020  
   people are so

that     so

say     let's     this  

01:37:34.120   01:37:34.130  
say they're   look at this
  

01:37:34.130   01:37:36.640  
say they're   look at this
question    you  

01:37:36.640   01:37:36.650  
   look at it this way you
  

01:37:36.650   01:37:39.219  
   look at it this way you
obviously     think     to  

01:37:39.219   01:37:39.229  
   to
  

01:37:39.229   01:37:41.770  
   to
stand     question     you

stand up   yes so you
  

01:37:41.780   01:37:43.810  
stand up   yes so you
think     standing     a  

01:37:43.810   01:37:43.820  
think that standing   up and asking a
  

01:37:43.820   01:37:46.330  
think that standing   up and asking a
question     up  

01:37:46.330   01:37:46.340  
question is better than not standing   up
  

01:37:46.340   01:37:48.219  
question is better than not standing   up
and     a  

01:37:48.219   01:37:48.229  
and asking   a question yes okay that's a
  

01:37:48.229   01:37:51.100  
and asking   a question yes okay that's a
hierarchy    without  

01:37:51.100   01:37:51.110  
hierarchy   of values yes okay without
  

01:37:51.110   01:37:53.109  
hierarchy   of values yes okay without
the    act  

01:37:53.109   01:37:53.119  
the   act
  

01:37:53.119   01:37:55.899  
the   act
of     course     wait  

01:37:55.899   01:37:55.909  
   wait
  

01:37:55.909   01:37:57.669  
   wait
it's     the  

01:37:57.669   01:37:57.679  
it's hardly why   I'm defending the
  

01:37:57.679   01:38:01.060  
it's hardly why   I'm defending the
hierarchy     hierarchy     right

01:38:01.070   01:38:02.890  
hierarchy   right 
   in  

01:38:02.890   01:38:02.900  
   there is a hierarchy in
  

01:38:02.900   01:38:05.679  
   there is a hierarchy in
society     hierarchies  

01:38:05.679   01:38:05.689  
society no there's multiple hierarchies
 

01:38:05.689   01:38:08.049  
society no there's multiple hierarchies
in     society    that  

01:38:08.049   01:38:08.059  
in society   right yes and you say that
  

01:38:08.059   01:38:09.459  
in society   right yes and you say that
they     the  

01:38:09.459   01:38:09.469  
they are   based at you you invoke the
  

01:38:09.469   01:38:11.439  
they are   based at you you invoke the
lobster     in  

01:38:11.439   01:38:11.449  
lobster   right that they are based in in
  

01:38:11.449   01:38:14.290  
lobster   right that they are based in in
nature    inevitable  

01:38:14.290   01:38:14.300  
nature   I said that they were inevitable
  

01:38:14.300   01:38:17.890  
nature   I said that they were inevitable 
   my  

01:38:17.890   01:38:17.900  
  yes yes they were inevitable good but my
  

01:38:17.900   01:38:20.529  
  yes yes they were inevitable good but my
point     is     a  

01:38:20.529   01:38:20.539  
point   dude you have a
  

01:38:20.539   01:38:22.870  
point   dude you have a
broader     this     is  

01:38:22.870   01:38:22.880  
broader point than free speech   is
  

01:38:22.880   01:38:25.929  
broader point than free speech   is
one    yes  

01:38:25.929   01:38:25.939  
one   of the things you talk about yes yes

  okay whereas I think there are some
other     more  

01:38:29.049   01:38:29.059  
  other activists who focus on more
  

01:38:29.059   01:38:31.540  
  other activists who focus on more
exclusive     activist     some

more   exclusively on free speech whereas
  

01:38:38.959   01:38:40.569  
more   exclusively on free speech whereas

you have other goals in mind
but     of    more  

01:38:42.449   01:38:42.459  
but one of   the things that you're more
  

01:38:42.459   01:38:45.219  
but one of   the things that you're more 
   the  

01:38:45.219   01:38:45.229  
  inflammatory language and fair it's the
  

01:38:45.229   01:38:46.600  
  inflammatory language and fair it's the
substantive     disagreement     I  

01:38:46.600   01:38:46.610  
   done I
  

01:38:46.610   01:38:48.580

I'm I've got more   than my fair share of
  

01:42:29.310   01:42:34.570  
I'm I've got more   than my fair share of
faults     but  

01:42:34.570   01:42:34.580  
faults and a temper is one of them but
 

01:42:34.580   01:42:41.540

was a surprise to   into

   to see how deep these
  

01:43:57.630   01:44:03.140  
   to see how deep these
values     not  

01:44:03.140   01:44:03.150  
values were but I would say   that not

values were but I would say   that not 
   the

they're     are

they're     that's  

01:49:32.600   01:49:32.610  
they're your enemy   and I think that's
  

01:49:32.610   01:49:34.160  
they're your enemy   and I think that's
the     way     with

the right   to read Nietzsche with
  

01:49:34.170   01:49:38.000  
the right   to read Nietzsche with
regards     was  

01:49:38.000   01:49:38.010  
regards to Christianity so he there was
 

01:49:38.010   01:49:41.480  
regards to Christianity so he there was
plenty     of    what  

01:49:41.480   01:49:41.490  
plenty of   rot and that was part of what
  

01:49:41.490   01:49:44.620  
plenty of   rot and that was part of what 
   God  

01:49:44.620   01:49:44.630  
  was causing let's say the death of God
  

01:49:44.630   01:49:48.050  
  was causing let's say the death of God
now     that  

01:49:48.050   01:49:48.060  
  now it isn't obvious at all that
  

01:49:48.060   01:49:52.190  
  now it isn't obvious at all that 
   to  

01:49:52.190   01:49:52.200  
   II opposed to
  

01:49:52.200   01:49:55.100  
   II opposed to
the     ideas     many  

01:49:55.100   01:49:55.110  
the founding ideas   in fact there's many
  

01:49:55.110   01:49:56.960  
the founding ideas   in fact there's many

question   would be how do you define what 
   of  

01:50:48.200   01:50:48.210

01:57:02.250   01:57:04.430  
about   about the stories I just wanted to
ask     very     broad  

01:57:04.430   01:57:04.440  
ask you although it may be   broad
  

01:57:04.440   01:57:07.040  
ask you although it may be   broad
question     of     the  

01:57:07.040   01:57:07.050  
   the
  

01:57:07.050   01:57:11.479  
   the
religious     is  

01:57:11.479   01:57:11.489  
religious in stories and religious is
 

01:57:11.489   01:57:13.550  
religious in stories and religious is
something     the    structure  

01:57:13.550   01:57:13.560  
something like the   grammatical structure
  

01:57:13.560   01:57:16.040  
something like the   grammatical structure
of     stories     you  

01:57:16.040   01:57:16.050  
of stories   you
  

01:57:16.050   01:57:18.520  
of stories   you
look     a     story  

01:57:18.520   01:57:18.530  
look at what   story
  

01:57:18.530   01:57:22.370  
look at what   story
that's     story  

01:57:22.370   01:57:22.380  
that's religious yeah it's not   a story
  

01:57:22.380   01:57:24.470  
that's religious yeah it's not   a story
otherwise     like     particular  

01:57:24.470   01:57:24.480  
otherwise like   a story is a particular
  

01:57:24.480   01:57:26.899  
otherwise like   a story is a particular
sort     again     sense  

01:57:26.899   01:57:26.909  
sort   in a simplest sense
  

01:57:26.909   01:57:29.060  
sort   in a simplest sense 
   get  

01:57:29.060   01:57:29.070  
  the story is an account of how to get
  

01:57:29.070   01:57:32.919  
  the story is an account of how to get 
   map  

01:57:32.919   01:57:32.929  
   point B it's like a map
  

01:57:32.929   01:57:35.840  
   point B it's like a map
but     inherent  

01:57:35.840   01:57:35.850  
but there's a value   structure inherent
  

01:57:35.850   01:57:37.310  
but there's a value   structure inherent
in    you  

01:57:37.310   01:57:37.320  
in   that obviously because otherwise you
  

01:57:37.320   01:57:39.229  
in   that obviously because otherwise you
wouldn't     point     so  

01:57:39.229   01:57:39.239  
wouldn't go from point   A to point B so
  

01:57:39.239   01:57:41.540  
wouldn't go from point   A to point B so 
   a  

01:57:41.540   01:57:41.550  
   to make the map means to adopt a
  

01:57:41.550   01:57:43.100  
   to make the map means to adopt a
value     story  

01:57:43.100   01:57:43.110  
value structure   but there but the story
  

01:57:43.110   01:57:44.419  
value structure   but there but the story
is     complicated     that  

01:57:44.419   01:57:44.429  
is actually   that
  

01:57:44.429   01:57:46.399  
is actually   that
because     you     to  

01:57:46.399   01:57:46.409  
because as you   to
  

01:57:46.409   01:57:48.979  
because as you   to
point     radical  

01:57:48.979   01:57:48.989  
point B processes of radical
 

01:57:48.989   01:57:51.700  
point B processes of radical
transformation     often    and  

01:57:51.700   01:57:51.710  
transformation are often   necessary and
  

01:57:51.710   01:57:55.189  
transformation are often   necessary and
the     processes  

01:57:55.189   01:57:55.199  
the the deep stories about the processes
 

01:57:55.199   01:57:57.350  
the the deep stories about the processes
of     as 

01:57:57.350   01:57:57.360  
of radical transformation that occur as
 

01:57:57.360   01:57:59.390  
of radical transformation that occur as
you     from    basically  

01:57:59.390   01:57:59.400  
you move from   point A to B are basically
  

01:57:59.400   01:58:01.850  
you move from   point A to B are basically 
   from  

01:58:01.850   01:58:01.860  
   from
  

01:58:01.860   01:58:05.060  
   from
religious     I  

01:58:05.060   01:58:05.070  
  religious stories now the reason they I
  

01:58:05.070   01:58:06.709  
  religious stories now the reason they I
think    to  

01:58:06.709   01:58:06.719  
think   the reason they they tend to
  

01:58:06.719   01:58:09.050  
think   the reason they they tend to
become     it  

01:58:09.050   01:58:09.060  
become religious let's say is   because it
  

01:58:09.060   01:58:10.790  
become religious let's say is   because it
has     with     between  

01:58:10.790   01:58:10.800  
has something to do with   the gap between
  

01:58:10.800   01:58:13.550  
has something to do with   the gap between
the     the  

01:58:13.550   01:58:13.560  
the finite   incomprehensible and the
  

01:58:13.560   01:58:15.830  
the finite   incomprehensible and the
infinite     uncomprehensible     like  

01:58:15.830   01:58:15.840  
infinite and uncomprehensible   it's like
  

01:58:15.840   01:58:17.419  
infinite and uncomprehensible   it's like
we     incomprehensible  

01:58:17.419   01:58:17.429  
we live in the finite   incomprehensible
  

01:58:17.429   01:58:19.700  
we live in the finite   incomprehensible
but    and  

01:58:19.700   01:58:19.710  
   we're surrounded by the infinite and
  

01:58:19.710   01:58:21.470  
   we're surrounded by the infinite and 
   a  

01:58:21.470   01:58:21.480  
   and there has to be a
  

01:58:21.480   01:58:23.720  
   and there has to be a
border     between     a  

01:58:23.720   01:58:23.730  
border between   those of some like a
  

01:58:23.730   01:58:26.030  
border between   those of some like a
mediating     poetry     art  

01:58:26.030   01:58:26.040  
mediating border that's poetry   and art
  

01:58:26.040   01:58:28.340  
mediating border that's poetry   and art
that's     and  

01:58:28.340   01:58:28.350  
that's narrative that's   religion and
  

01:58:28.350   01:58:31.640  
that's narrative that's   religion and
it's     that     metaphorical  

01:58:31.640   01:58:31.650  
it's that   it's that strange metaphorical
  

01:58:31.650   01:58:34.669  
it's that   it's that strange metaphorical
reality     not     and  

01:58:34.669   01:58:34.679  
reality let's say that's not   factual and
  

01:58:34.679   01:58:37.220  
reality let's say that's not   factual and
it's     comprehensible     not  

01:58:37.220   01:58:37.230  
it's not comprehensible   but that's not
  

01:58:37.230   01:58:39.500  
it's not comprehensible   but that's not
infinitely     incomprehensible     it's  

01:58:39.500   01:58:39.510  
infinitely incomprehensible   either it's
  

01:58:39.510   01:58:43.130  
infinitely incomprehensible   either it's
a     between     you  

01:58:43.130   01:58:43.140  
a bridge between   the two so and as you
  

01:58:43.140   01:58:45.200  
a bridge between   the two so and as you
move     the     and  

01:58:45.200   01:58:45.210  
move closer to the   infinite and
  

01:58:45.210   01:58:48.320  
move closer to the   infinite and
incomprehensible     bridge     you  

01:58:48.320   01:58:48.330  
incomprehensible   you
  

01:58:48.330   01:58:50.390

incomprehensible   that was his
critique     that

critique of the strict rationalist that

critique of the strict rationalist that
they     can't    to  

01:59:06.929   01:59:06.939  
they can't   that it's hard for them to

they can't   that it's hard for them to

01:59:10.209   01:59:13.049  
   and
that's     a     lot

that's   lot
  

01:59:13.059   01:59:15.600  
that's   lot
of     from     idea  

01:59:15.600   01:59:15.610  
   idea
  

01:59:15.610   01:59:17.729  
   idea 
   a  

01:59:17.729   01:59:17.739  
  was that rationality is embedded in a
  

01:59:17.739   01:59:20.189  
  was that rationality is embedded in a
dream     infinite  

01:59:20.189   01:59:20.199  
dream   like there's the infinite
  

01:59:20.199   01:59:21.839  
dream   like there's the infinite
unknowable     dream  

01:59:21.839   01:59:21.849  
unknowable and then there's the dream
 

01:59:21.849   01:59:24.390  
unknowable and then there's the dream
   the  

01:59:24.390   01:59:24.400  
  and then inside the dream is the
  

01:59:24.400   01:59:26.790  
  and then inside the dream is the
rational     believe     be  

01:59:26.790   01:59:26.800  
rational domain and I believe   that to be
  

01:59:26.800   01:59:31.199  
rational domain and I believe   that to be 
   have  

01:59:31.199   01:59:31.209  
   have
  

01:59:31.209   01:59:31.919  
   have
to     dream  

01:59:31.919   01:59:31.929  
to dream
 

01:59:31.929   01:59:35.100  
to dream
if     it 

01:59:35.100   01:59:35.110  
if we don't dream we we go insane it
 

01:59:35.110   01:59:37.560  
if we don't dream we we go insane it
doesn't     very    there's  

01:59:37.560   01:59:37.570  
doesn't take very   long and so there's
  

01:59:37.570   01:59:42.049  
doesn't take very   long and so there's
there's     poetic  

01:59:42.049   01:59:42.059  
 
 

01:59:42.059   01:59:45.029  
 
conceptualization     that    it  

01:59:45.029   01:59:45.039  
conceptualization that   grounds us and it
  

01:59:45.039   01:59:47.640  
conceptualization that   grounds us and it
has     seriously     them  

01:59:47.640   01:59:47.650  
has to   them
  

01:59:47.650   01:59:50.580  
has to   them
the     of     think  

01:59:50.580   01:59:50.590  
the rational critics of   Dreams think
  

01:59:50.590   01:59:52.859  
the rational critics of   Dreams think
about     activity  

01:59:52.859   01:59:52.869  
about them as random neural activity
 

01:59:52.869   01:59:55.109  
about them as random neural activity
it's     there's    you  

01:59:55.109   01:59:55.119  
it's like there's   nothing right when you
  

01:59:55.119   01:59:58.140  
it's like there's   nothing right when you
look     a     a  

01:59:58.140   01:59:58.150  
look   TV screen that's not on a
  

01:59:58.150   02:00:02.069  
look   TV screen that's not on a
channel    dream  

02:00:02.069   02:00:02.079  
channel   that's random when you dream
  

02:00:02.079   02:00:04.100  
channel   that's random when you dream
something     sophisticated  

02:00:04.100   02:00:04.110  
something   complex and sophisticated
  

02:00:04.110   02:00:10.739  
something   complex and sophisticated 
   the  

02:00:10.739   02:00:10.749  
   so the
  

02:00:10.749   02:00:13.259  
   so the
metaphor     we  

02:00:13.259   02:00:13.269  
metaphor surrounds us let's say   and we
  

02:00:13.269   02:00:14.759  
metaphor surrounds us let's say   and we
can    can  

02:00:14.759   02:00:14.769  
can   we can
  

02:00:14.769   02:00:16.439  
can   we can
undermine     in  

02:00:16.439   02:00:16.449  
undermine   it but there's real danger in
  

02:00:16.449   02:00:26.870  
undermine   it but there's real danger in 
   so  

02:00:26.870   02:00:26.880  
 
 

02:00:26.880   02:00:28.950  
 
take     from    take  

02:00:28.950   02:00:28.960  
take one question from   here then take

   what's
your     it  

02:00:46.830   02:00:46.840  
your   view of institutional racism is it
  

02:00:46.840   02:00:51.030  
your   view of institutional racism is it
a     thing     radical

02:01:36.790   02:01:39.660

   problem with the radical
leftist     that  

02:01:48.630   02:01:48.640  
leftist is that they take   the fact that
  

02:01:48.640   02:01:50.970  
leftist is that they take   the fact that
societal     to  

02:01:50.970   02:01:50.980  
societal structures are tyrannical to
 

02:01:50.980   02:01:52.830  
societal structures are tyrannical to
some     arbitrary    course  

02:01:52.830   02:01:52.840  
some degree in arbitrary   course
  

02:01:52.840   02:01:54.480  
some degree in arbitrary   course
they     they're     and  

02:01:54.480   02:01:54.490  
they are because   imperfect and
  

02:01:54.490   02:01:58.410  
they are because   imperfect and
then     complexity  

02:01:58.410   02:01:58.420  
then they   obliterated the complexity
  

02:01:58.420   02:02:01.590  
then they   obliterated the complexity
with     of  

02:02:01.590   02:02:01.600  
with that claim so there's lots of
 

02:02:01.600   02:02:05.340  
with that claim so there's lots of
reasons   is  

02:02:05.340   02:02:05.350  
reasons   inequality systemic bias is
  

02:02:05.350   02:02:08.130  
reasons   inequality systemic bias is
one     open  

02:02:08.130   02:02:08.140  
one of them   - what - it's an open
  

02:02:08.140   02:02:10.410  
one of them   - what - it's an open 
   bias  

02:02:10.410   02:02:10.420  
  question to what degree systemic bias
  

02:02:10.420   02:02:14.460  
  question to what degree systemic bias
plays     let's  

02:02:14.460   02:02:14.470  
plays in in the inequality problem   let's
  

02:02:14.470   02:02:16.590  
plays in in the inequality problem   let's
say     that     could  

02:02:16.590   02:02:16.600  
say   we could
  

02:02:16.600   02:02:18.870  
say   we could
hypothetically     certain  

02:02:18.870   02:02:18.880  
hypothetically address with a certain
 

02:02:18.880   02:02:21.390  
hypothetically address with a certain
degree     of    intelligence  

02:02:21.390   02:02:21.400  
degree of   detachment and intelligence
  

02:02:21.400   02:02:26.100  
degree of   detachment and intelligence
so     and  

02:02:26.100   02:02:26.110  
so no system is perfect   not and
  

02:02:26.110   02:02:30.430  
so no system is perfect   not and 
   us  

02:02:30.430   02:02:30.440  
 
 

02:02:30.440   02:02:35.570  
 
reasonable     answer    that's  

02:02:35.570   02:02:35.580  
reasonable reasonable answer   that's
  

02:02:35.580   02:02:41.480  
reasonable reasonable answer   that's
that's     wise     it's  

02:02:41.480   02:02:41.490  
that's wise   right so I think it's
  

02:02:41.490   02:02:44.330  
that's wise   right so I think it's
safe    of

objects   aren't just there in any simple
  

02:04:37.890   02:04:40.160  
objects   aren't just there in any simple 
   number  

02:04:40.160   02:04:40.170  
  sense so okay there's an infinite number
  

02:04:40.170   02:04:42.760  
  sense so okay there's an infinite number 
   problem  

02:04:42.760   02:04:42.770  
   no problem
  

02:04:42.770   02:04:45.280  
   no problem
there's     an     viable  

02:04:45.280   02:04:45.290  
there's not an   of viable
  

02:04:45.290   02:04:47.930  
there's not an   of viable
interpretations     big  

02:04:47.930   02:04:47.940  
interpretations   okay that's a big
  

02:04:47.940   02:04:50.060  
interpretations   okay that's a big
problem    of  

02:04:50.060   02:04:50.070  
problem   okay and a little bit of
  

02:04:50.070   02:04:51.530  
problem   okay and a little bit of
thinking     through     a  

02:04:51.530   02:04:51.540  
thinking through   that would have gone a
  

02:04:51.540   02:04:53.180  
thinking through   that would have gone a
long     for     so  

02:04:53.180   02:04:53.190  
long ways for   so
  

02:04:53.190   02:04:56.660  
long ways for   so
that's     what's  

02:04:56.660   02:04:56.670  
that's that's number one and   then what's
  

02:04:56.670   02:04:57.350  
that's that's number one and   then what's
the     one  

02:04:57.350   02:04:57.360  
the   other one
  

02:04:57.360   02:05:04.130  
the   other one
oh     yes     okay  

02:05:04.130   02:05:04.140  
oh yes   then the other problem is okay
  

02:05:04.140   02:05:05.570  
oh yes   then the other problem is okay 
   of  

02:05:05.570   02:05:05.580  
   number of
  

02:05:05.580   02:05:07.250  
   number of

02:05:07.250   02:05:07.260  
  interpretations we won't make any one
  

02:05:07.260   02:05:09.620  
  interpretations we won't make any one
canonical     the  

02:05:09.620   02:05:09.630  
  canonical all right well then how the
  

02:05:09.630   02:05:12.260  
  canonical all right well then how the
hell     you  

02:05:12.260   02:05:12.270  
hell are   you going to act because you
  

02:05:12.270   02:05:14.300  
hell are   you going to act because you
have     if  

02:05:14.300   02:05:14.310  
have to make a   value system canonical if
  

02:05:14.310   02:05:16.520  
have to make a   value system canonical if
you're     act     solve  

02:05:16.520   02:05:16.530  
you're gonna act   solve
  

02:05:16.530   02:05:18.140  
you're gonna act   solve
that     problem     slip  

02:05:18.140   02:05:18.150  
   how about we just slip
  

02:05:18.150   02:05:20.270  
   how about we just slip
Marxism     in     not  

02:05:20.270   02:05:20.280  
Marxism in   the carpet and not
  

02:05:20.280   02:05:23.030  
Marxism in   the carpet and not
notice     problem     us  

02:05:23.030   02:05:23.040  
notice the   then that gives us
  

02:05:23.040   02:05:25.670  
notice the   then that gives us
something     come  

02:05:25.670   02:05:25.680  
something   to do it's like people come
  

02:05:25.680   02:05:27.260  
something   to do it's like people come
out     criticize     dr.  

02:05:27.260   02:05:27.270  
out and   say dr.
  

02:05:27.270   02:05:28.580  
out and   say dr.
Peterson    that  

02:05:28.580   02:05:28.590  
Peterson   doesn't understand that
  

02:05:28.590   02:05:30.290  
Peterson   doesn't understand that
post-modernism    in  

02:05:30.290   02:05:30.300  
post-modernism   and Marxism are in
  

02:05:30.300   02:05:33.020  
post-modernism   and Marxism are in
commensurate     actually     I  

02:05:33.020   02:05:33.030  
commensurate it's like yeah   I
  

02:05:33.030   02:05:35.479  
commensurate it's like yeah   I
do     that     postmodern  

02:05:35.479   02:05:35.489  
do understand that   the postmodern
  

02:05:35.489   02:05:37.700  
do understand that   the postmodern 
   understand  

02:05:37.700   02:05:37.710  
  neo-marxists don't seem to understand
  

02:05:37.710   02:05:40.790  
  neo-marxists don't seem to understand
that     a     postmodern  

02:05:40.790   02:05:40.800  
that so how can you   postmodern
  

02:05:40.800   02:05:43.459  
that so how can you   postmodern

in the   postmodernist
  

02:05:47.250   02:05:49.100  
in the   postmodernist
types     were  

02:05:49.100   02:05:49.110  
types like Foucault and Derrida were

the Marxism was as far as   tell

   postmodern lenses that we

Didion    think  

02:06:29.229   02:06:29.239  
Didion   Gerard could at least think

Didion   Gerard could at least think
and     the  

02:06:31.400   02:06:31.410  
and I mean you can't throw all the
 

02:06:31.410   02:06:34.370  
and I mean you can't throw all the
   know  

02:06:34.370   02:06:34.380  
  postmodernist into the same jug you know
  

02:06:34.380   02:06:36.350  
  postmodernist into the same jug you know
but     and  

02:06:36.350   02:06:36.360  
but I would say it's   still Derrida and
  

02:06:36.360   02:06:37.670  
but I would say it's   still Derrida and 
   pernicious  

02:06:37.670   02:06:37.680  
  Foucault of had the most pernicious
  

02:06:37.680   02:06:47.360  
  Foucault of had the most pernicious
effects     they  

02:06:47.360   02:06:47.370  
effects well   well the problem is they
  

02:06:47.370   02:06:49.189  
effects well   well the problem is they
didn't     like

didn't deal with it seriously   it's like

02:06:51.800   02:06:51.810  
you can't just   say no meta-narrative

corporations suffer from   this tension 
   they're  

02:15:35.589   02:15:35.599  
   they're
  

02:15:35.599   02:15:39.339  
   they're
started     get  

02:15:39.339   02:15:39.349

02:15:41.589   02:15:41.599  
  going and get algorithm eyes they're run
  

02:15:41.599   02:15:43.359  
  going and get algorithm eyes they're run
by     the  

02:15:43.359   02:15:43.369  
by conscientious people   but then the
  

02:15:43.369   02:15:44.830  
by conscientious people   but then the
conscientious     people     down  

02:15:44.830   02:15:44.840  
conscientious people   down
  

02:15:44.840   02:15:46.330  
conscientious people   down
one     and     environment  

02:15:46.330   02:15:46.340  
one track and   if the environment
  

02:15:46.340   02:15:48.010  
one track and   if the environment 
   disappears  

02:15:48.010   02:15:48.020  
  transforms the whole company disappears
  

02:15:48.020   02:15:50.979  
  transforms the whole company disappears 
   the  

02:15:50.979   02:15:50.989  
  so I would say you take a look at the
  

02:15:50.989   02:15:53.500  
  so I would say you take a look at the
conscientiousness     you  

02:15:53.500   02:15:53.510  
conscientiousness score   you see if you
  

02:15:53.510   02:15:54.640  
conscientiousness score   you see if you
can     discipline  

02:15:54.640   02:15:54.650  
can figure out how to discipline
 

02:15:54.650   02:15:56.800  
can figure out how to discipline
   can  

02:15:56.800   02:15:56.810  
  yourself a bit more and see if you can
  

02:15:56.810   02:15:58.839  
  yourself a bit more and see if you can
figure     schedule     not  

02:15:58.839   02:15:58.849

02:16:01.250   02:16:03.129  
like a prison but like like a structured
set     of    you  

02:16:03.129   02:16:03.139

02:16:03.139   02:16:05.260

understand     in     be

to long run you're going   to have to find
  

02:16:09.889   02:16:12.069  
to long run you're going   to have to find

02:16:12.069   02:16:12.079  
   to you or
  

02:16:12.079   02:16:13.600

it     could     or

02:16:13.610   02:16:16.200

whatever     missing  

02:16:16.200   02:16:16.210  
whatever that fill in that missing
 

02:16:16.210   02:16:19.240  
whatever that fill in that missing
conscientiousness     so    the  

02:16:19.240   02:16:19.250  
conscientiousness gap so   I guess the
  

02:16:19.250   02:16:21.129  
conscientiousness gap so   I guess the

our     as

our conflict comes and as far as

our conflict comes and as far as
   you  

02:16:30.520   02:16:30.530  
   what are some things that you

   what are some things that you
know    erotic  

02:16:38.690   02:16:38.700  
 
 

02:16:38.700   02:16:40.230  
 
we'll     that 

02:16:40.230   02:16:40.240  
we'll look into that
 

02:16:40.240   02:16:45.121  
we'll look into that
   only  

02:16:45.121   02:16:45.131  
   I can only
  

02:16:45.131   02:16:48.750  
   I can only
its     are  

02:16:48.750   02:16:48.760  
  its it high levels of neuroticism are
  

02:16:48.760   02:16:50.610  
  its it high levels of neuroticism are
problematic     in     relationship  

02:16:50.610   02:16:50.620  
problematic in   a relationship
  

02:16:50.620   02:16:54.480  
problematic in   a relationship
it's     why     are  

02:16:54.480   02:16:54.490  
it's probably why   75% of divorces are
  

02:16:54.490   02:16:57.060  
it's probably why   75% of divorces are
initiated     because     are  

02:16:57.060   02:16:57.070  
initiated by   women are
  

02:16:57.070   02:16:59.070  
initiated by   women are
higher     I  

02:16:59.070   02:16:59.080  
higher in neuroticism than men   and I
  

02:16:59.080   02:17:00.541  
higher in neuroticism than men   and I
think    they  

02:17:00.541   02:17:00.551  
think   they
  

02:17:00.551   02:17:02.280  
think   they
have     sensitive     infant

don't   sure
it's     of  

02:17:10.230   02:17:10.240  
it's a supposition   but high levels of
  

02:17:10.240   02:17:11.670  
it's a supposition   but high levels of
neuroticism     tend     a  

02:17:11.670   02:17:11.680  
neuroticism do tend   to make a

neuroticism do tend   to make a

the     of  

02:17:19.831   02:17:19.841  
the question is where what the source of

the question is where what the source of
   it  

02:17:21.780   02:17:21.790  
  the high level of neuroticism is it
  

02:17:21.790   02:17:23.400  
  the high level of neuroticism is it
might     but     it  

02:17:23.400   02:17:23.410  
might   it
  

02:17:23.410   02:17:24.780  
might   it
also     be     an  

02:17:24.780   02:17:24.790  
also might be   indicative of an
  

02:17:24.790   02:17:26.430  
also might be   indicative of an
underlying     depression  

02:17:26.430   02:17:26.440  
underlying   anxiety disorder depression
  

02:17:26.440   02:17:29.581  
underlying   anxiety disorder depression
or     because  

02:17:29.581   02:17:29.591  
or or a physiological   problem because
  

02:17:29.591   02:17:30.990  
or or a physiological   problem because
they     high  

02:17:30.990   02:17:31.000  
they can manifest themselves in high
 

02:17:31.000   02:17:32.460  
they can manifest themselves in high
levels     and    so  

02:17:32.460   02:17:32.470  
levels of negative emotion and   so
  

02:17:32.470   02:17:35.250  
levels of negative emotion and   so
there's     doing  

02:17:35.250   02:17:35.260  
there's always the   possibility of doing
  

02:17:35.260   02:17:37.081  
there's always the   possibility of doing
something     that     tell  

02:17:37.081   02:17:37.091  
   what I usually tell
  

02:17:37.091   02:17:38.970  
   what I usually tell
my     are     neuroticism  

02:17:38.970   02:17:38.980  
   high in neuroticism
  

02:17:38.980   02:17:42.780  
   high in neuroticism
is    up  

02:17:42.780   02:17:42.790  
is   one get up
  

02:17:42.790   02:17:45.000  
is   one get up
at    okay  

02:17:45.000   02:17:45.010  
at   morning okay

at   morning okay 
   your

  because that helps stabilize your

  because that helps stabilize your
circadian     rhythms     large  

02:17:49.800   02:17:49.810  
circadian rhythms   number two eat a large

morning   fat based
because     neuroticism  

02:17:57.331   02:17:57.341  
because if you're high on neuroticism
 

02:17:57.341   02:17:59.010  
because if you're high on neuroticism
and   eat  

02:17:59.010   02:17:59.020  
and   you stress yourself before you eat
  

02:17:59.020   02:18:02.910  
and   you stress yourself before you eat
you     emotional  

02:18:02.910   02:18:02.920  
you you dis regulate your your emotional
 

02:18:02.920   02:18:05.070  
you you dis regulate your your emotional
reaction     essentially    can  

02:18:05.070   02:18:05.080  
reaction systems essentially   you can
  

02:18:05.080   02:18:07.100  
reaction systems essentially   you can
tree     again  

02:18:07.100   02:18:07.110  
tree regulate them till you sleep again
 

02:18:07.110   02:18:09.990  
tree regulate them till you sleep again
   and  

02:18:09.990   02:18:10.000  
  so other than that goodwill and
  

02:18:10.000   02:18:15.020

for   beginning lectures at university 
   topic  

02:19:36.190   02:19:36.200  
   on a topic
  

02:19:36.200   02:19:37.750  
   on a topic 
   they're  

02:19:37.750   02:19:37.760  
  but they only know as much as they're
  

02:19:37.760   02:19:39.669  
  but they only know as much as they're
saying     the     kind  

02:19:39.669   02:19:39.679  
saying in the   lecture and they get kind
  

02:19:39.679   02:19:41.410  
saying in the   lecture and they get kind 
   it  

02:19:41.410   02:19:41.420  
  of stuck to their notes because of it
  

02:19:41.420   02:19:43.629  
  of stuck to their notes because of it
but     much  

02:19:43.629   02:19:43.639  
but   you want to know ten times as much
  

02:19:43.639   02:19:45.700  
but   you want to know ten times as much
as     and  

02:19:45.700   02:19:45.710  
as you are saying in the lecture   and
  

02:19:45.710   02:19:48.670  
as you are saying in the lecture   and
then     path  

02:19:48.670   02:19:48.680  
then   you can specify a stepping path
  

02:19:48.680   02:19:51.011  
then   you can specify a stepping path
through     other  

02:19:51.011   02:19:51.021  
through it and elaborate with the other
 

02:19:51.021   02:19:52.540  
through it and elaborate with the other
things   you  

02:19:52.540   02:19:52.550  
things   you
  

02:19:52.550   02:19:54.610  
things   you
have    also  

02:19:54.610   02:19:54.620  
have   also
  

02:19:54.620   02:19:56.080  
have   also
have     reading     because  

02:19:56.080   02:19:56.090  
have   because
  

02:19:56.090   02:19:57.850  
have   because
that's     where  

02:19:57.850   02:19:57.860  
that's where the   synthesize that's where
  

02:19:57.860   02:20:01.120  
that's where the   synthesize that's where
the     the  

02:20:01.120   02:20:01.130  
the synthesizing comes so that's on   the
  

02:20:01.130   02:20:02.761  
the synthesizing comes so that's on   the
input     on     side  

02:20:02.761   02:20:02.771  
input   the output side
  

02:20:02.771   02:20:05.410  
input   the output side 
   techniques  

02:20:05.410   02:20:05.420  
  well there's some tricks techniques
  

02:20:05.420   02:20:07.780  
  well there's some tricks techniques 
   in  

02:20:07.780   02:20:07.790  
  let's say is like if you're speaking in
  

02:20:07.790   02:20:10.450  
  let's say is like if you're speaking in
front     delivering  

02:20:10.450   02:20:10.460  
front of   a group you are not delivering
  

02:20:10.460   02:20:13.900  
front of   a group you are not delivering
a     you're  

02:20:13.900   02:20:13.910  
a talk   to a group that's not what you're
  

02:20:13.910   02:20:15.700  
a talk   to a group that's not what you're
doing     thing  

02:20:15.700   02:20:15.710  
doing the talk isn't   a package thing
  

02:20:15.710   02:20:18.490  
doing the talk isn't   a package thing
that     to     isn't  

02:20:18.490   02:20:18.500  
that you present   a group there isn't
  

02:20:18.500   02:20:21.220  
that you present   a group there isn't
a     individuals  

02:20:21.220   02:20:21.230  
a group there's a bunch of individuals
 

02:20:21.230   02:20:24.130  
a group there's a bunch of individuals
and     to    a  

02:20:24.130   02:20:24.140  
and you talk to   them so when I talk to a
  

02:20:24.140   02:20:26.290  
and you talk to   them so when I talk to a
group    a  

02:20:26.290   02:20:26.300  
group   one at a
  

02:20:26.300   02:20:26.710  
group   one at a
time 

02:20:26.710   02:20:26.720  
time
 

02:20:26.720   02:20:28.511  
time
   you  

02:20:28.511   02:20:28.521  
   that makes it easier to because you
  

02:20:28.521   02:20:30.400  
   that makes it easier to because you
know     to     like  

02:20:30.400   02:20:30.410  
know how to   it's like
  

02:20:30.410   02:20:31.960  
know how to   it's like 
   well  

02:20:31.960   02:20:31.970  
   you talk to a thousand people well
  

02:20:31.970   02:20:33.130  
   you talk to a thousand people well 
   too  

02:20:33.130   02:20:33.140  
   it's too
  

02:20:33.140   02:20:35.350  
   it's too
intimidating     thousand  

02:20:35.350   02:20:35.360  
intimidating   but there isn't a thousand
  

02:20:35.360   02:20:38.830  
intimidating   but there isn't a thousand
people     there's     thousand  

02:20:38.830   02:20:38.840  
people   a thousand
  

02:20:38.840   02:20:40.420  
people   a thousand
individuals     just     an  

02:20:40.420   02:20:40.430  
individuals and so you just   look at an
  

02:20:40.430   02:20:42.490  
individuals and so you just   look at an
individual     something     you  

02:20:42.490   02:20:42.500  
individual   and you
  

02:20:42.500   02:20:45.700  
individual   and you
can     engaged     look  

02:20:45.700   02:20:45.710  
can tell if they're engaged   they look
  

02:20:45.710   02:20:47.620  
can tell if they're engaged   they look 
   they  

02:20:47.620   02:20:47.630  
   look interested or they
  

02:20:47.630   02:20:49.780  
   look interested or they
look    maybe  

02:20:49.780   02:20:49.790  
look   maybe
  

02:20:49.790   02:20:51.310  
look   maybe
they're     look     at  

02:20:51.310   02:20:51.320  
they're   at
  

02:20:51.320   02:20:54.100  
they're   at
someone     feedback  

02:20:54.100   02:20:54.110  
someone else   and they give you feedback
  

02:20:54.110   02:20:56.410  
someone else   and they give you feedback
about     doing     thing  

02:20:56.410   02:20:56.420  
about   so one thing
  

02:20:56.420   02:21:00.940  
about   so one thing 
   yeah  

02:21:00.940   02:21:00.950  
   have something to say yeah
  

02:21:00.950   02:21:02.560  
   have something to say yeah
thing     attention     you're  

02:21:02.560   02:21:02.570  
thing is pay attention   to who you're
  

02:21:02.570   02:21:05.171  
thing is pay attention   to who you're
talking     very  

02:21:05.171   02:21:05.181  
talking to   because unless you're very
  

02:21:05.181   02:21:07.540  
talking to   because unless you're very 
   seems  

02:21:07.540   02:21:07.550  
   then that seems
  

02:21:07.550   02:21:09.400  
   then that seems 
   know  

02:21:09.400   02:21:09.410  
  unlikely in your case because you know
  

02:21:09.410   02:21:11.591  
  unlikely in your case because you know
you     moderately  

02:21:11.591   02:21:11.601  
you present yourself at least moderately
 

02:21:11.601   02:21:14.350  
you present yourself at least moderately
well     know    don't  

02:21:14.350   02:21:14.360  
well you know   and well I mean I don't
  

02:21:14.360   02:21:16.120  
well you know   and well I mean I don't
know    on  

02:21:16.120   02:21:16.130  
know   on
  

02:21:16.130   02:21:19.060  
know   on
first     sight     fine  

02:21:19.060   02:21:19.070  
first sight   you know you're doing fine
  

02:21:19.070   02:21:20.801  
first sight   you know you're doing fine
so     pay  

02:21:20.801   02:21:20.811  
so the   probability that if you pay
  

02:21:20.811   02:21:23.140  
so the   probability that if you pay
attention     you're  

02:21:23.140   02:21:23.150  
attention   to the individuals that you're
  

02:21:23.150   02:21:26.921  
attention   to the individuals that you're 
   of  

02:21:26.921   02:21:26.931  
   that your natural wealth of
  

02:21:26.931   02:21:29.740  
   that your natural wealth of
social     is  

02:21:29.740   02:21:29.750  
social skill will manifest itself   is
  

02:21:29.750   02:21:32.860  
social skill will manifest itself   is
extremely     deliver  

02:21:32.860   02:21:32.870  
extremely   high and so you don't deliver
  

02:21:32.870   02:21:35.470  
extremely   high and so you don't deliver
a     really  

02:21:35.470   02:21:35.480  
  a talk to an audience that's a really
  

02:21:35.480   02:21:36.551  
  a talk to an audience that's a really
bad     you're  

02:21:36.551   02:21:36.561  
bad way of   thinking about you're
  

02:21:36.561   02:21:38.350  
bad way of   thinking about you're
actually     conversation     with  

02:21:38.350   02:21:38.360  
actually engaged in   with
  

02:21:38.360   02:21:40.210  
actually engaged in   with
an    talking  

02:21:40.210   02:21:40.220  
an   audience even if they're not talking
  

02:21:40.220   02:21:43.480  
an   audience even if they're not talking
they're     nodding     position  

02:21:43.480   02:21:43.490  
they're nodding   and shifting position
  

02:21:43.490   02:21:46.120  
they're nodding   and shifting position
and     know     and  

02:21:46.120   02:21:46.130  
and you know   looking like this or and
  

02:21:46.130   02:21:49.000  
and you know   looking like this or and
you     and  

02:21:49.000   02:21:49.010  
you can you   can pull all that in and and
  

02:21:49.010   02:21:52.270  
you can you   can pull all that in and and
and     which  

02:21:52.270   02:21:52.280  
and use it to govern the level at which
 

02:21:52.280   02:21:56.280  
and use it to govern the level at which
you're     addressing    so

you're addressing   so
  

02:21:56.290   02:21:58.511  
you're addressing   so
the     I     well  

02:21:58.511   02:21:58.521  
the last thing I   would say is well
  

02:21:58.521   02:22:00.430  
the last thing I   would say is well
having     the     communicator  

02:22:00.430   02:22:00.440  
having the   a good communicator

having the   a good communicator 
   I  

02:22:02.680   02:22:02.690  
   you think well I
  

02:22:02.690   02:22:06.370  
   you think well I 
   well  

02:22:06.370   02:22:06.380  
  could bunch us that to some degree well
  

02:22:06.380   02:22:07.511  
  could bunch us that to some degree well
there     can  

02:22:07.511   02:22:07.521  
there isn't   anything that you can

there isn't   anything that you can
possibly     a

starting to get fuzzy minded and I've
learned     point    so  

02:37:59.550   02:37:59.560  
learned to quit at that point   mostly so

learned to quit at that point   mostly so
we     before     you  

02:38:02.250   02:38:02.260  
we talked a bit   yeah before you
  

02:38:02.260   02:38:04.170  
we talked a bit   yeah before you
started    phrase  

02:38:04.170   02:38:04.180  
started   don't know exactly how to phrase
  

02:38:04.180   02:38:06.540  
started   don't know exactly how to phrase
this     like  

02:38:06.540   02:38:06.550  
this and I   think that this will be like
  

02:38:06.550   02:38:08.430  
this and I   think that this will be like
I     of  

02:38:08.430   02:38:08.440  
  I do what I like acknowledge that all of
  

02:38:08.440   02:38:09.990  
  I do what I like acknowledge that all of
this     it's  

02:38:09.990   02:38:10.000  
this   Q&amp;A has been amazing because it's
  

02:38:10.000   02:38:11.910  
this   Q&amp;A has been amazing because it's
basically     a     with  

02:38:11.910   02:38:11.920  
basically been a   lecture mixed with
  

02:38:11.920   02:38:14.400  
basically been a   lecture mixed with
reality     that's     combination  

02:38:14.400   02:38:14.410  
reality and that's   a good combination
  

02:38:14.410   02:38:17.670  
reality and that's   a good combination
yeah    don't  

02:38:17.670   02:38:17.680  
   a good combination and I don't
  

02:38:17.680   02:38:20.040  
   a good combination and I don't
think     actually  

02:38:20.040   02:38:20.050  
  think many speakers I go to actually
  

02:38:20.050   02:38:21.990  
  think many speakers I go to actually
know     did  

02:38:21.990   02:38:22.000  
know how   to combine that the way you did
  

02:38:22.000   02:38:25.290  
know how   to combine that the way you did
so     guess  

02:38:25.290   02:38:25.300  
so thank   you for that but uh I guess
  

02:38:25.300   02:38:26.700  
so thank   you for that but uh I guess

sign     right     that  

02:44:12.660   02:44:12.670  
sign right   and so my opinion is that
  

02:44:12.670   02:44:14.980  
sign right   and so my opinion is that
that     little     paradox  

02:44:14.980   02:44:14.990  
that makes a little   bit of a paradox
  

02:44:14.990   02:44:17.530  
that makes a little   bit of a paradox 
   we're  

02:44:17.530   02:44:17.540  
   you know we are wired we're
  

02:44:17.540   02:44:20.290  
   you know we are wired we're
hardwired     to  

02:44:20.290   02:44:20.300  
hardwired essentially become adept to
 

02:44:20.300   02:44:23.710  
hardwired essentially become adept to
change     ourselves    to  

02:44:23.710   02:44:23.720  
change we're able to change ourselves   to
  

02:44:23.720   02:44:25.360  
change we're able to change ourselves   to
respond     to     environment  

02:44:25.360   02:44:25.370  
respond to   our environment

behavior   the actual the heaters
at     actually  

02:44:31.389   02:44:31.399  
at the   derivation of what's actually
  

02:44:31.399   02:44:33.580  
at the   derivation of what's actually
changing     is     lot  

02:44:33.580   02:44:33.590  
changing so you're arguing   that a lot
  

02:44:33.590   02:44:35.290  
changing so you're arguing   that a lot
of    touch  

02:44:35.290   02:44:35.300  
of   know it touch
  

02:44:35.300   02:44:36.969  
of   know it touch 
   do  

02:44:36.969   02:44:36.979  
   so how do
  

02:44:36.979   02:44:38.920  
   so how do
you     of  

02:44:38.920   02:44:38.930  
you explain you know what aspects of
 

02:44:38.930   02:44:40.810  
you explain you know what aspects of
political     just 

02:44:40.810   02:44:40.820  
political phenomena or you know just
 

02:44:40.820   02:44:43.570  
political phenomena or you know just
   powerful  

02:44:43.570   02:44:43.580  
  social discourse what is so powerful
  

02:44:43.580   02:44:45.420  
  social discourse what is so powerful
about     overcomes     our  

02:44:45.420   02:44:45.430  
about that that it overcomes   our
  

02:44:45.430   02:44:48.270  
about that that it overcomes   our
predisposed     different  

02:44:48.270   02:44:48.280  
predisposed to different
 

02:44:48.280   02:44:54.090  
predisposed to different
well     it's 

02:44:54.090   02:44:54.100  
well changes changes especially if it's
 

02:44:54.100   02:44:56.800  
well changes changes especially if it's
the     change 

02:44:56.800   02:44:56.810  
the more radical the necessary change
 

02:44:56.810   02:44:59.139  
the more radical the necessary change
the     that    like  

02:44:59.139   02:44:59.149  
the more pain that   like
  

02:44:59.149   02:45:01.870  
the more pain that   like
the     a  

02:45:01.870   02:45:01.880  
the more opportunity as well   but and a
  

02:45:01.880   02:45:03.730  
the more opportunity as well   but and a
lot    painfully  

02:45:03.730   02:45:03.740  
lot   of what we learn we learn painfully
  

02:45:03.740   02:45:05.620  
lot   of what we learn we learn painfully 
   people  

02:45:05.620   02:45:05.630  
  and so it's not surprising that people
  

02:45:05.630   02:45:07.929  
  and so it's not surprising that people 
   in  

02:45:07.929   02:45:07.939  
   in
  

02:45:07.939   02:45:10.150  
   in
pain     frequently  

02:45:10.150   02:45:10.160  
pain   and anxiety very frequently
  

02:45:10.160   02:45:12.280  
pain   and anxiety very frequently
everyone     that  

02:45:12.280   02:45:12.290  
everyone knows that   like the things that
  

02:45:12.290   02:45:13.929  
everyone knows that   like the things that
really     life  

02:45:13.929   02:45:13.939  
really   that you really learned in life
  

02:45:13.939   02:45:16.540  
really   that you really learned in life 
   it  

02:45:16.540   02:45:16.550  
  it's like there was no joy man like it
  

02:45:16.550   02:45:18.700  
  it's like there was no joy man like it
took     people  

02:45:18.700   02:45:18.710  
took you out and so the fact that people
 

02:45:18.710   02:45:22.060  
took you out and so the fact that people
   but  

02:45:22.060   02:45:22.070  
   surprising but
  

02:45:22.070   02:45:24.280  
   surprising but
it     it     just  

02:45:24.280   02:45:24.290  
it doesn't help that's the thing it   just
  

02:45:24.290   02:45:26.710  
it doesn't help that's the thing it   just
stores     catastrophe     and  

02:45:26.710   02:45:26.720  
stores up the catastrophe   and
  

02:45:26.720   02:45:30.160  
stores up the catastrophe   and
so     better     eat  

02:45:30.160   02:45:30.170  
so the better the better   idea is to eat
  

02:45:30.170   02:45:31.719  
so the better the better   idea is to eat
a     little     you  

02:45:31.719   02:45:31.729  
a little   that you
  

02:45:31.729   02:45:33.570  
a little   that you 
   month  

02:45:33.570   02:45:33.580  
  don't have to overdose in a month
  

02:45:33.580   02:45:36.420  
  don't have to overdose in a month
it's     that     the  

02:45:36.420   02:45:36.430  
it's something   and it is the
  

02:45:36.430   02:45:40.410  
it's something   and it is the
case     think     you  

02:45:40.410   02:45:40.420  
case   because you don't you
  

02:45:40.420   02:45:42.360  
case   because you don't you
aren't     don't  

02:45:42.360   02:45:42.370  
aren't forced   first of all you don't
  

02:45:42.370   02:45:43.980  
aren't forced   first of all you don't
learn     learn     I  

02:45:43.980   02:45:43.990  
learn unless you're forced to   I
  

02:45:43.990   02:45:45.690  
learn unless you're forced to   I
know     that  

02:45:45.690   02:45:45.700  
know there's alternatives to that
 

02:45:45.700   02:45:47.190  
know there's alternatives to that
   for  

02:45:47.190   02:45:47.200  
  there's the voluntary search for
  

02:45:47.200   02:45:48.990  
  there's the voluntary search for
knowledge     fine     and  

02:45:48.990   02:45:49.000  
knowledge   thing and
  

02:45:49.000   02:45:52.260  
knowledge   thing and
that     antidote     apart  

02:45:52.260   02:45:52.270  
that is an antidote   to this but apart
  

02:45:52.270   02:45:56.160  
that is an antidote   to this but apart
from     you  

02:45:56.160   02:45:56.170  
from that speaking more practically you
 

02:45:56.170   02:45:58.050  
from that speaking more practically you
tend     to    forced  

02:45:58.050   02:45:58.060  
tend not to   learn unless you're forced
  

02:45:58.060   02:46:00.510  
tend not to   learn unless you're forced
to    to  

02:46:00.510   02:46:00.520  
to   to
  

02:46:00.520   02:46:02.490  
to   to
learn     and  

02:46:02.490   02:46:02.500  
learn by force are difficult lessons and
 

02:46:02.500   02:46:07.740  
learn by force are difficult lessons and
so     people    not  

02:46:07.740   02:46:07.750  
so people   very prone to not do not
  

02:46:07.750   02:46:11.309  
so people   very prone to not do not
seek     that     but  

02:46:11.309   02:46:11.319  
seek that   but
  

02:46:11.319   02:46:12.690  
seek that   but
it's     the  

02:46:12.690   02:46:12.700  
it's because they   don't understand the
  

02:46:12.700   02:46:17.000  
it's because they   don't understand the
consequences    you  

02:46:17.000   02:46:17.010  
consequences   know you you
  

02:46:17.010   02:46:19.710  
consequences   know you you
it's     they're  

02:46:19.710   02:46:19.720  
it's because   maybe it's because they're
  

02:46:19.720   02:46:21.360  
it's because   maybe it's because they're
convinced     some     for  

02:46:21.360   02:46:21.370  
convinced that   way of for
  

02:46:21.370   02:46:23.429  
convinced that   way of for
stalling    and  

02:46:23.429   02:46:23.439  
stalling   the necessary learning and
  

02:46:23.439   02:46:26.849  
stalling   the necessary learning and
there     it  

02:46:26.849   02:46:26.859  
there isn't any way of for stalling   it
  

02:46:26.859   02:46:28.320  
there isn't any way of for stalling   it
all     the  

02:46:28.320   02:46:28.330  
all you do is make   it worse in the
  

02:46:28.330   02:46:30.450  
all you do is make   it worse in the 
   you  

02:46:30.450   02:46:30.460  
  future you make yourself smaller and you
  

02:46:30.460   02:46:33.599  
  future you make yourself smaller and you
make     why  

02:46:33.599   02:46:33.609  
make the lesson harder and so that's why
 

02:46:33.609   02:46:36.000  
make the lesson harder and so that's why
in     so    there's  

02:46:36.000   02:46:36.010  
in so   many religious doctrines there's
  

02:46:36.010   02:46:38.880  
in so   many religious doctrines there's
emphasis     humility     and  

02:46:38.880   02:46:38.890  
emphasis on humility   you know and
  

02:46:38.890   02:46:42.420  
emphasis on humility   you know and 
   to  

02:46:42.420   02:46:42.430  
   it's to
  

02:46:42.430   02:46:45.210  
   it's to
understand     you     so  

02:46:45.210   02:46:45.220  
understand that you   don't know enough so
  

02:46:45.220   02:46:46.469  
understand that you   don't know enough so
that     be  

02:46:46.469   02:46:46.479  
that your life isn't going   to be
  

02:46:46.479   02:46:49.290  
that your life isn't going   to be
miserable    to  

02:46:49.290   02:46:49.300  
miserable   chance you get to

miserable   chance you get to
grab    you  

02:46:51.780   02:46:51.790  
grab   something new that will help you
  

02:46:51.790   02:46:54.000

   as  

02:46:54.000   02:46:54.010
