so     thinking    about  

00:00:12.549   00:00:12.559  
so I've been thinking   this week about
  

00:00:12.559   00:00:15.670  
so I've been thinking   this week about
doing     month     a  

00:00:15.670   00:00:15.680  
doing this   on a
  

00:00:15.680   00:00:25.430  
doing this   on a
continuing     so  

00:00:25.430   00:00:25.440  
 
 

00:00:25.440   00:00:28.650  
 
so     think    be  

00:00:28.650   00:00:28.660  
so I think   be
  

00:00:28.660   00:00:30.150  
so I think   be
here     this  

00:00:30.150   00:00:30.160  
here although it's harder to rent this
 

00:00:30.160   00:00:32.760  
here although it's harder to rent this
   if  

00:00:32.760   00:00:32.770  
   if
  

00:00:32.770   00:00:34.230  
   if
it     somewhere     else  

00:00:34.230   00:00:34.240  
it isn't   else
  

00:00:34.240   00:00:36.000  
it isn't   else 
   doing  

00:00:36.000   00:00:36.010  
  and because I'd like to continue doing
  

00:00:36.010   00:00:38.100  
  and because I'd like to continue doing 
   it  

00:00:38.100   00:00:38.110  
   it
  

00:00:38.110   00:00:40.710  
   it
and     be  

00:00:40.710   00:00:40.720  
and   and once a month would really be
  

00:00:40.720   00:00:42.150  
and   and once a month would really be 
   the  

00:00:42.150   00:00:42.160  
   really do the
  

00:00:42.160   00:00:46.170  
   really do the
background    probably  

00:00:46.170   00:00:46.180  
background   work and and I could probably
  

00:00:46.180   00:00:47.460  
background   work and and I could probably
do     of     because  

00:00:47.460   00:00:47.470  
do   years because
  

00:00:47.470   00:00:50.310  
do   years because 
   but  

00:00:50.310   00:00:50.320  
   quickly but
  

00:00:50.320   00:00:52.440  
   quickly but
that's    shouldn't  

00:00:52.440   00:00:52.450  
   shouldn't
  

00:00:52.450   00:00:54.660  
   shouldn't
go     that's  

00:00:54.660   00:00:54.670  
go any faster than   it can go and that's
  

00:00:54.670   00:00:56.509  
go any faster than   it can go and that's
how     anyways  

00:00:56.509   00:00:56.519  
how   it that's how it seems to me anyways

   been doing a lot of
  

00:01:35.650   00:01:37.920  
   been doing a lot of
thinking     these     stories  

00:01:37.920   00:01:37.930  
thinking   stories
  

00:01:37.930   00:01:40.260  
thinking   stories
trying     about  

00:01:40.260   00:01:40.270  
  trying to understand what they're about
  

00:01:40.270   00:01:42.240  
  trying to understand what they're about
and     these  

00:01:42.240   00:01:42.250  
and and then there's all these
 

00:01:42.250   00:01:44.820  
and and then there's all these
commentaries   I  

00:01:44.820   00:01:44.830  
commentaries   I
  

00:01:44.830   00:01:47.360  
commentaries   I
think     called     has  

00:01:47.360   00:01:47.370  
think it's called   Bible hub that has
  

00:01:47.370   00:01:49.710  
think it's called   Bible hub that has
every     single     is  

00:01:49.710   00:01:49.720  
every single   verse of the Bible is
  

00:01:49.720   00:01:52.890  
every single   verse of the Bible is
listed     verse  

00:01:52.890   00:01:52.900  
listed there   and then with each verse
  

00:01:52.900   00:01:54.990  
listed there   and then with each verse
there     ten  

00:01:54.990   00:01:55.000  
there are like they've aggregated   ten
  

00:01:55.000   00:01:57.480  
there are like they've aggregated   ten
commentaries     from     commentaries  

00:01:57.480   00:01:57.490  
commentaries from   ten commentaries
  

00:01:57.490   00:01:58.770  
commentaries from   ten commentaries
from    years  

00:01:58.770   00:01:58.780  
from   four hundred years
  

00:01:58.780   00:02:01.920  
from   four hundred years 
   on  

00:02:01.920   00:02:01.930  
  and so there's like a dense page on
  

00:02:01.930   00:02:04.290  
  and so there's like a dense page on
every     one     things  

00:02:04.290   00:02:04.300  
every line and that's one   of the things
  

00:02:04.300   00:02:05.550  
every line and that's one   of the things 
   this  

00:02:05.550   00:02:05.560  
  that's really interesting about this
  

00:02:05.560   00:02:08.100  
  that's really interesting about this 
   so  

00:02:08.100   00:02:08.110  
   it's aggregated so
  

00:02:08.110   00:02:10.919  
   it's aggregated so
much     it's  

00:02:10.919   00:02:10.929  
much commentary   that it's that it's it's
  

00:02:10.929   00:02:12.750  
much commentary   that it's that it's it's
much     much

much bigger than looks the book is much
 

00:02:12.760   00:02:14.670  
much bigger than looks the book is much
   been  

00:02:14.670   00:02:14.680  
   it looks and so it's been
  

00:02:14.680   00:02:16.140  
   it looks and so it's been

  those two and the fact that this site is
  

00:02:18.250   00:02:19.979

   commentaries split
  

00:02:19.989   00:02:21.420  
   commentaries split
up     by     rapidly

things that   were older than that so
that's     interesting

  things we talked about how you might
understand     divine  

00:02:45.649   00:02:45.659  
understand the idea of   the divine
  

00:02:45.659   00:02:48.500  
understand the idea of   the divine
encounter     also     paralleled

   disappears  

00:02:51.500   00:02:51.510  
  that with the idea that God disappears
  

00:02:51.510   00:02:54.770  
  that with the idea that God disappears
in     Old     as  

00:02:54.770   00:02:54.780  
in the   boughs out as

the   stories progress and that seems to
  

00:02:56.640   00:02:59.179  
the   stories progress and that seems to 
   the  

00:02:59.179   00:02:59.189  
   the
  

00:02:59.189   00:03:00.470  
   the
sequencing    because  

00:03:00.470   00:03:00.480  
sequencing   of the stories right because
  

00:03:00.480   00:03:01.490  
sequencing   of the stories right because
all     were     by  

00:03:01.490   00:03:01.500  
all the books were   written by
  

00:03:01.500   00:03:03.979  
all the books were   written by
independent    and  

00:03:03.979   00:03:03.989  
independent   people different people and
  

00:03:03.989   00:03:05.660  
independent   people different people and
then     by     other  

00:03:05.660   00:03:05.670  
then they were aggregated by   other
  

00:03:05.670   00:03:08.180  
then they were aggregated by   other
people     continuity  

00:03:08.180   00:03:08.190  
people and so the narrative continuity
 

00:03:08.190   00:03:10.039  
people and so the narrative continuity
is     kind    that's  

00:03:10.039   00:03:10.049  
is some kind   of emergent property that's
  

00:03:10.049   00:03:12.440  
is some kind   of emergent property that's
it's     this     interaction  

00:03:12.440   00:03:12.450  
it's a   interaction
  

00:03:12.450   00:03:15.080  
it's a   interaction
between     writers     over  

00:03:15.080   00:03:15.090  
   over
  

00:03:15.090   00:03:17.390  
   over 
   that  

00:03:17.390   00:03:17.400  
  centuries and it's it's strange that
  

00:03:17.400   00:03:19.009  
  centuries and it's it's strange that
given     are     multiple  

00:03:19.009   00:03:19.019  
given   also multiple
  

00:03:19.019   00:03:21.170  
given   also multiple
coherent     know  

00:03:21.170   00:03:21.180  
coherent narratives that   United you know
  

00:03:21.180   00:03:23.149  
coherent narratives that   United you know
it's     not     to  

00:03:23.149   00:03:23.159  
it's really it's   to
  

00:03:23.159   00:03:24.500  
it's really it's   to
understand    least  

00:03:24.500   00:03:24.510  
understand   that but it does at least
  

00:03:24.510   00:03:27.979  
understand   that but it does at least 
   third

   generations and that's
  

00:11:36.640   00:11:38.760  
   generations and that's
why     build     would  

00:11:38.760   00:11:38.770  
why he could build   an ark that would
  

00:11:38.770   00:11:41.730  
why he could build   an ark that would
sustain     humanity

sustain him and him and and humanity
 

00:11:41.740   00:11:43.830

   not only did he walk with God which
  

00:11:46.060   00:11:47.580  
   not only did he walk with God which
is     something     the  

00:11:47.580   00:11:47.590  
   that we talked about in the
  

00:11:47.590   00:11:49.350  
   that we talked about in the
context    but  

00:11:49.350   00:11:49.360  
context   of the Sermon on the Mount but
  

00:11:49.360   00:11:51.300  
context   of the Sermon on the Mount but
he    with  

00:11:51.300   00:11:51.310  
he   established proper relationships with
  

00:11:51.310   00:11:54.000  
he   established proper relationships with
his     so     what  

00:11:54.000   00:11:54.010  
his family with   what
  

00:11:54.010   00:11:55.920  
his family with   what
that     meant     he  

00:11:55.920   00:11:55.930  
   only was he
  

00:11:55.930   00:11:58.410  
   only was he
well     his  

00:11:58.410   00:11:58.420  
well integrated as a person but his
 

00:11:58.420   00:11:59.880  
well integrated as a person but his
level   the  

00:11:59.880   00:11:59.890  
level   of integration had reached the
  

00:11:59.890   00:12:01.440  
level   of integration had reached the
point    him  

00:12:01.440   00:12:01.450  
point   where it stretched out beyond him
  

00:12:01.450   00:12:04.020  
point   where it stretched out beyond him
and    was  

00:12:04.020   00:12:04.030  
and   encompassed his family and so it was
  

00:12:04.030   00:12:05.790  
and   encompassed his family and so it was

state you can see infinity in the   finite
and     and  

00:17:08.870   00:17:08.880  
and   you might say well you can say and

and   you might say well you can say and
you     can     have

you say your   ups properly then you
  

00:17:26.340   00:17:27.680  
you say your   ups properly then you 
   you  

00:17:27.680   00:17:27.690  
   when you

wake   up and then you figure out what
  

00:17:32.700   00:17:33.920  
wake   up and then you figure out what
clothes    they  

00:17:33.920   00:17:33.930  
clothes   you should wear because they
  

00:17:33.930   00:17:35.330

have to be arranged properly   in your
dresser    place  

00:17:36.650   00:17:36.660  
   then you have to have some place
  

00:17:36.660   00:17:38.180  
   then you have to have some place
to    to  

00:17:38.180   00:17:38.190  
to   clothes and you're going to
  

00:17:38.190   00:17:39.170  
to   clothes and you're going to
have     you     out  

00:17:39.170   00:17:39.180  
have some clothes   out
  

00:17:39.180   00:17:40.160  
have some clothes   out
what     going     clothes

what you're going   those clothes
  

00:17:40.170   00:17:42.830  
what you're going   those clothes
to     have  

00:17:42.830   00:17:42.840  
to   do right and then that means you have
  

00:17:42.840   00:17:43.940  
to   do right and then that means you have
to     going     do  

00:17:43.940   00:17:43.950  
to   do
  

00:17:43.950   00:17:45.950  
to   do
and     that  

00:17:45.950   00:17:45.960  
and then your room has to serve that
 

00:17:45.960   00:17:47.720  
and then your room has to serve that
purpose   set  

00:17:47.720   00:17:47.730  
purpose   doesn't set
  

00:17:47.730   00:17:50.000  
purpose   doesn't set

00:17:54.990   00:17:57.110  
be unhappy   the room
because     that     the  

00:17:57.110   00:17:57.120

00:22:14.450   00:22:15.880  
  and you think well again that's pretty
good    because  

00:22:15.880   00:22:15.890  
good   news although it's strange because
  

00:22:15.890   00:22:17.860  
good   news although it's strange because
you'd     expect     Abraham

  that isn't what happens at all it
  

00:22:23.810   00:22:26.110  
  that isn't what happens at all it
doesn't     all     never

  the stage setting for a play that if
  

00:28:58.630   00:29:00.210  
  the stage setting for a play that if
there     hanging     walls

there was a rifle   on the walls
  

00:29:00.220   00:29:02.250  
there was a rifle   on the walls
and     I  

00:29:02.250   00:29:02.260  
and it had better been used before   I
  

00:29:02.260   00:29:03.870  
and it had better been used before   I
believe     shouldn't

the reason   that the biblical writers are
  

00:29:10.090   00:29:12.150  
the reason   that the biblical writers are
pointing    is  

00:29:12.150   00:29:12.160  
pointing   out that Abraham's wife is
  

00:29:12.160   00:29:13.530  
pointing   out that Abraham's wife is
barren     real  

00:29:13.530   00:29:13.540  
barren is because it's a real
 

00:29:13.540   00:29:15.690  
barren is because it's a real
catastrophe     Abraham    Sarah

catastrophe for Abraham   Sarah
  

00:29:15.700   00:29:19.740  
catastrophe for Abraham   Sarah
as     it's  

00:29:19.740   00:29:19.750  
as well that she's barren and so it's
 

00:29:19.750   00:29:21.630  
as well that she's barren and so it's
   at  

00:29:21.630   00:29:21.640  
   that Abraham's in at
  

00:29:21.640   00:29:23.580

it's   also see what happens as the story
progresses     and

say well   it's random it's the vall it's
  

00:38:19.190   00:38:21.250  
say well   it's random it's the vall it's
better     random     that  

00:38:21.250   00:38:21.260  
better not be random   I can tell you that

00:43:40.069   00:43:42.940  
and and they're valuable   that's 
   if  

00:43:42.940   00:43:42.950  
   even if
  

00:43:42.950   00:43:44.200  
   even if
you     modern     person

  but the act of sacrificing something 
   to  

00:43:49.299   00:43:49.309  
  might have some dramatic compulsion to
  

00:43:49.309   00:43:51.160  
  might have some dramatic compulsion to
it     and  

00:43:51.160   00:43:51.170  
it   you know to go out into a flock and
  

00:43:51.170   00:43:53.410  
it   you know to go out into a flock and 
   to  

00:43:53.410   00:43:53.420  
  to take something that's newborn and to
  

00:43:53.420   00:43:55.029  
  to take something that's newborn and to
cut     throat     to  

00:43:55.029   00:43:55.039  
cut its throat   and to bleed it and to
  

00:43:55.039   00:43:57.670  
cut its throat   and to bleed it and to
burn     to  

00:43:57.670   00:43:57.680  
burn it might be a way   of indicating to
  

00:43:57.680   00:43:59.019  
burn it might be a way   of indicating to
yourself    serious  

00:43:59.019   00:43:59.029  
yourself   that you're actually serious
  

00:43:59.029   00:44:01.299  
yourself   that you're actually serious 
   obvious  

00:44:01.299   00:44:01.309  
   so obvious
  

00:44:01.309   00:44:03.579  
   so obvious 
   like  

00:44:03.579   00:44:03.589  
   we have rituals of seriousness like
  

00:44:03.589   00:44:05.680  
   we have rituals of seriousness like
that     so     that  

00:44:05.680   00:44:05.690  
that now and so it's not so   obvious that
  

00:44:05.690   00:44:07.120  
that now and so it's not so   obvious that 
   anything  

00:44:07.120   00:44:07.130  
   about anything
  

00:44:07.130   00:44:09.009  
   about anything 
   good  

00:44:09.009   00:44:09.019  
  and so maybe that's not such a good
  

00:44:09.019   00:44:10.539  
  and so maybe that's not such a good 
   be  

00:44:10.539   00:44:10.549  
   so maybe we shouldn't be
  

00:44:10.549   00:44:11.829  
   so maybe we shouldn't be 
   so  

00:44:11.829   00:44:11.839  
   people were so
  

00:44:11.839   00:44:13.210  
   people were so
archaic     superstitious  

00:44:13.210   00:44:13.220  
archaic   and primitive and superstitious
  

00:44:13.220   00:44:15.489  
archaic   and primitive and superstitious 
   something  

00:44:15.489   00:44:15.499  
   possible that they knew something
  

00:44:15.499   00:44:18.670  
   possible that they knew something 
   or  

00:44:18.670   00:44:18.680  
  that we don't it's certainly in the or
  

00:44:18.680   00:44:20.140  
  that we don't it's certainly in the or 
   that  

00:44:20.140   00:44:20.150  
   of the things that
  

00:44:20.150   00:44:22.509  
   of the things that
maintains     is  

00:44:22.509   00:44:22.519  
maintains Abraham's covenant with God is
 

00:44:22.519   00:44:24.069  
maintains Abraham's covenant with God is
his     sacrifice 

00:44:24.069   00:44:24.079  
his continual willingness to sacrifice
 

00:44:24.079   00:44:26.650  
his continual willingness to sacrifice
   so  

00:44:26.650   00:44:26.660  
  it it's so that sacrificial issue is so
  

00:44:26.660   00:44:29.109  
  it it's so that sacrificial issue is so
important     because     committed  

00:44:29.109   00:44:29.119  
important   not committed
  

00:44:29.119   00:44:30.430  
important   not committed

   unless you're willing to
  

00:44:30.440   00:44:31.569  
   unless you're willing to

   it
commitment     same  

00:44:33.819   00:44:33.829

00:45:53.180   00:45:55.720  
   be good
for    try  

00:45:55.720   00:45:55.730  
   but we do more than that we try
  

00:45:55.730   00:45:57.280  
   but we do more than that we try
to    set  

00:45:57.280   00:45:57.290  
   think okay well what how can we set
  

00:45:57.290   00:45:58.990  
   think okay well what how can we set
this     and  

00:45:58.990   00:45:59.000  
this up   so it's really good for you and
  

00:45:59.000   00:46:01.660  
this up   so it's really good for you and 
   that  

00:46:01.660   00:46:01.670  
   all the side consequences of that
  

00:46:01.670   00:46:02.890  
   all the side consequences of that 
   other  

00:46:02.890   00:46:02.900  
   for other
  

00:46:02.900   00:46:05.650  
   for other 
   often  

00:46:05.650   00:46:05.660  
   are often
  

00:46:05.660   00:46:07.180  
   are often
also     trying     get  

00:46:07.180   00:46:07.190  
also tended about trying   to get
  

00:46:07.190   00:46:08.230  
also tended about trying   to get 
   themselves  

00:46:08.230   00:46:08.240  
   for themselves
  

00:46:08.240   00:46:09.940  
   for themselves 
   or  

00:46:09.940   00:46:09.950  
  because they feel that it's selfish or
  

00:46:09.950   00:46:11.830  
  because they feel that it's selfish or
that     it     it  

00:46:11.830   00:46:11.840  
that they don't   so we set it
  

00:46:11.840   00:46:13.420  
that they don't   so we set it 
   set  

00:46:13.420   00:46:13.430  
   well look we're going to set
  

00:46:13.430   00:46:16.570  
   well look we're going to set
it     so     that  

00:46:16.570   00:46:16.580  
   plainly obvious that
  

00:46:16.580   00:46:18.610  
   plainly obvious that
this     the  

00:46:18.610   00:46:18.620  
this will not   harm the structure of the
  

00:46:18.620   00:46:21.220  
this will not   harm the structure of the
universe     need  

00:46:21.220   00:46:21.230  
universe   for you to have what you need
  

00:46:21.230   00:46:23.290  
universe   for you to have what you need
and     it     benefit  

00:46:23.290   00:46:23.300  
and   in a way that's of benefit
  

00:46:23.300   00:46:25.990  
and   in a way that's of benefit 
   to  

00:46:25.990   00:46:26.000  
  to other people there's no downside to
  

00:46:26.000   00:46:28.780  
  to other people there's no downside to
that    you  

00:46:28.780   00:46:28.790  
that   okay if you
  

00:46:28.790   00:46:30.430  
that   okay if you
reach    the  

00:46:30.430   00:46:30.440  
reach   of the
  

00:46:30.440   00:46:31.810  
reach   of the
things     the  

00:46:31.810   00:46:31.820  
things that's   interesting about the
  

00:46:31.820   00:46:34.060  
things that's   interesting about the
biblical     as

  biblical stories Abrahamic stories as
well     to  

00:46:35.980   00:46:35.990  
well is that   God doesn't really seem to
  

00:46:35.990   00:46:38.170  
well is that   God doesn't really seem to 
   people  

00:46:38.170   00:46:38.180  
  be opposed to the success of the people

  be opposed to the success of the people 
   happens  

00:46:40.840   00:46:40.850  
   you know what happens

life more abundant   that's what happens
  

00:46:51.650   00:46:53.410  
life more abundant   that's what happens
it's     to     a  

00:46:53.410   00:46:53.420  
it's God isn't   be a
  

00:46:53.420   00:46:55.600  
it's God isn't   be a
miser     if  

00:46:55.600   00:46:55.610  
miser in the Old   Testament it's like if
  

00:46:55.610   00:46:58.120  
miser in the Old   Testament it's like if
you    you  

00:46:58.120   00:46:58.130  
you   and you
  

00:46:58.130   00:46:59.710  
you   and you
accept     the     the  

00:46:59.710   00:46:59.720  
accept the   covenant and you make the
  

00:46:59.720   00:47:02.320  
accept the   covenant and you make the 
   successful  

00:47:02.320   00:47:02.330  
  sacrifices then you get to be successful
  

00:47:02.330   00:47:04.270  
  sacrifices then you get to be successful
and    wildest  

00:47:04.270   00:47:04.280  
and   successful beyond your wildest
  

00:47:04.280   00:47:06.940  
and   successful beyond your wildest 
   to  

00:47:06.940   00:47:06.950  
   and that that's actually seems to
  

00:47:06.950   00:47:09.040  
   and that that's actually seems to 
   cool  

00:47:09.040   00:47:09.050  
  be okay with God and that's pretty cool
  

00:47:09.050   00:47:11.320  
  be okay with God and that's pretty cool
given     general  

00:47:11.320   00:47:11.330  
given that you   know that the general
  

00:47:11.330   00:47:13.570  
given that you   know that the general
notion     Old     all  

00:47:13.570   00:47:13.580  
notion   that all
  

00:47:13.580   00:47:16.120  
notion   that all 
   and  

00:47:16.120   00:47:16.130  
  he's doing is casting out curses and
  

00:47:16.130   00:47:17.710  
  he's doing is casting out curses and 
   to  

00:47:17.710   00:47:17.720  
   happens to
  

00:47:17.720   00:47:18.890  
   happens to 
   and  

00:47:18.890   00:47:18.900  
  wander and
  

00:47:18.900   00:47:20.299  
  wander and
I mean     of  

00:47:20.299   00:47:20.309  
I mean there's certainly no shortage of
 

00:47:20.309   00:47:23.359  
I mean there's certainly no shortage of
that   that  

00:47:23.359   00:47:23.369  
that   but but again it seems to me that
  

00:47:23.369   00:47:24.920  
that   but but again it seems to me that
that's    also  

00:47:24.920   00:47:24.930  
that's   that you also
  

00:47:24.930   00:47:26.870  
that's   that you also
don't     to  

00:47:26.870   00:47:26.880  
don't have   to be perfect in order for to
  

00:47:26.880   00:47:29.029  
don't have   to be perfect in order for to
have     other  

00:47:29.029   00:47:29.039  
have that   happen and then the other
  

00:47:29.039   00:47:31.220  
have that   happen and then the other
thing     issue     into  

00:47:31.220   00:47:31.230  
thing this is the   into
  

00:47:31.230   00:47:33.500  
thing this is the   into
the     leave  

00:47:33.500   00:47:33.510  
the unknown it's like well if   you leave
  

00:47:33.510   00:47:35.630  
the unknown it's like well if   you leave
your     your  

00:47:35.630   00:47:35.640  
your country   and your kin and your
  

00:47:35.640   00:47:37.849  
your country   and your kin and your
father's     a  

00:47:37.849   00:47:37.859  
father's house and you go out   into a
  

00:47:37.859   00:47:40.220  
father's house and you go out   into a
land     to  

00:47:40.220   00:47:40.230  
land that   your intuition guides you to
  

00:47:40.230   00:47:42.890  
land that   your intuition guides you to 
   radical  

00:47:42.890   00:47:42.900  
  you're going to undergo these radical
  

00:47:42.900   00:47:44.690  
  you're going to undergo these radical
transformations     sacrificial  

00:47:44.690   00:47:44.700  
transformations   this is the sacrificial
  

00:47:44.700   00:47:46.430  
transformations   this is the sacrificial
transformation    you're  

00:47:46.430   00:47:46.440  
transformation   you're you're
  

00:47:46.440   00:47:48.980  
transformation   you're you're
moving     into  

00:47:48.980   00:47:48.990  
moving forthrightly and voluntarily into
 

00:47:48.990   00:47:51.230  
moving forthrightly and voluntarily into
chaos     same    the  

00:47:51.230   00:47:51.240  
chaos right and that's the same   the
  

00:47:51.240   00:47:53.089  
chaos right and that's the same   the
dragon     story     and  

00:47:53.089   00:47:53.099  
dragon fight that's the   and
  

00:47:53.099   00:47:55.519  
dragon fight that's the   and
what     will  

00:47:55.519   00:47:55.529  
what will   happen there is that you will
  

00:47:55.529   00:47:58.250  
what will   happen there is that you will
transform     an  

00:47:58.250   00:47:58.260  
transform yourself and so the call to an
 

00:47:58.260   00:48:00.980  
transform yourself and so the call to an
ideal     sequence    of  

00:48:00.980   00:48:00.990  
ideal is also the call to a sequence   of
  

00:48:00.990   00:48:03.650  
ideal is also the call to a sequence   of
deaths     closer  

00:48:03.650   00:48:03.660  
deaths and rebirths that move you closer
 

00:48:03.660   00:48:05.930  
deaths and rebirths that move you closer
and   what  

00:48:05.930   00:48:05.940  
and   closer to the ideal and that's what
  

00:48:05.940   00:48:09.190  
and   closer to the ideal and that's what
that's     do  

00:48:09.190   00:48:09.200  
that's what God is   calling Abraham to do
  

00:48:09.200   00:48:20.670  
that's what God is   calling Abraham to do
in     story  

00:48:20.670   00:48:20.680  
 
 

00:48:20.680   00:48:24.809  
 
you     things    the  

00:48:24.809   00:48:24.819  
you see these things   echoed in the
  

00:48:24.819   00:48:27.250  
you see these things   echoed in the 
   stills  

00:48:27.250   00:48:27.260  
   stills
  

00:48:27.260   00:48:29.410  
   stills
that     and     this

00:48:31.309   00:48:33.010  
little   cricket so he's the still small 
   calls  

00:48:33.010   00:48:33.020  
   thing that calls
  

00:48:33.020   00:48:35.440  
   thing that calls
to     conscience  

00:48:35.440   00:48:35.450  
  to you it's your conscious conscience
  

00:48:35.450   00:48:37.359  
  to you it's your conscious conscience 
   and  

00:48:37.359   00:48:37.369  
  and part it's your intuition in part and
  

00:48:37.369   00:48:39.190  
  and part it's your intuition in part and
it's     great  

00:48:39.190   00:48:39.200  
it's the thing   that opens up the great

leather-bound book with gilt   lettering
it's     something  

00:48:51.130   00:48:51.140  
it's a valuable book   and it's something

it's a valuable book   and it's something
that's     you

   let's say you
have     world  

00:48:56.470   00:48:56.480  
have to be somewhere   where the world
  

00:48:56.480   00:48:58.120  
have to be somewhere   where the world
isn't     order     to

00:54:46.940   00:54:48.940  
  clinical evidence is clear about that
because     one     do

because   of the things that we do

because   of the things that we do
know     take     are

know is that if you take   people who are

know is that if you take   people who are
confronting     and

confronting terrible things and
 

00:54:53.450   00:54:56.530  
confronting terrible things and
shrinking   them  

00:54:56.530   00:54:56.540  
shrinking   from them and you teach them
  

00:54:56.540   00:54:59.320  
shrinking   from them and you teach them 
   that  

00:54:59.320   00:54:59.330  
   so that
  

00:54:59.330   00:55:01.130  
   so that

00:55:01.130   00:55:01.140  
  they can advance
  

00:55:01.140   00:55:05.720  
  they can advance
with     better     for

with courage everything works better   for
  

00:55:05.730   00:55:08.330  
with courage everything works better   for
them     their

them their fears decrease and their
 

00:55:08.340   00:55:11.870  
them their fears decrease and their
character     might    be  

00:55:11.870   00:55:11.880  
character grows and so there might   be
  

00:55:11.880   00:55:13.940  
character grows and so there might   be
enough     within     us

going   that you have not
  

01:01:51.219   01:01:53.579  
going   that you have not
yet    and  

01:01:53.579   01:01:53.589  
yet   something and
  

01:01:53.589   01:01:55.729  
yet   something and
so     is     moves  

01:01:55.729   01:01:55.739  
so what happens then is   the star moves
  

01:01:55.739   01:01:58.650  
so what happens then is   the star moves
you     move     no  

01:01:58.650   01:01:58.660  
you move   think no
  

01:01:58.660   01:02:00.120  
you move   think no 
   right  

01:02:00.120   01:02:00.130  
  that's not right I didn't get it right
  

01:02:00.130   01:02:02.069  
  that's not right I didn't get it right 
   there  

01:02:02.069   01:02:02.079  
  it isn't there it's actually there
  

01:02:02.079   01:02:04.289  
  it isn't there it's actually there
and     somewhere  

01:02:04.289   01:02:04.299  
and so then you you see it somewhere
 

01:02:04.299   01:02:06.299  
and so then you you see it somewhere
   and  

01:02:06.299   01:02:06.309  
   and
  

01:02:06.309   01:02:08.370  
   and
you     forward     happens  

01:02:08.370   01:02:08.380  
you move forward   that's what happens
  

01:02:08.380   01:02:13.799  
you move forward   that's what happens
is    the  

01:02:13.799   01:02:13.809  
is   continue as you change the
  

01:02:13.809   01:02:16.549  
is   continue as you change the 
   moves  

01:02:16.549   01:02:16.559  
  thing that guides you forward moves
  

01:02:16.559   01:02:20.309  
  thing that guides you forward moves
right     the  

01:02:20.309   01:02:20.319  
right it's like God in   the in the in the
  

01:02:20.319   01:02:22.170  
right it's like God in   the in the in the
desert    that  

01:02:22.170   01:02:22.180  
desert   that
  

01:02:22.180   01:02:24.420  
desert   that
you're     a  

01:02:24.420   01:02:24.430  
you're   following it's moving it's not a
  

01:02:24.430   01:02:26.789  
you're   following it's moving it's not a
permanent     thing     it  

01:02:26.789   01:02:26.799  
permanent   you move towards it it
  

01:02:26.799   01:02:29.459  
permanent   you move towards it it
moves     so  

01:02:29.459   01:02:29.469  
moves away   it guides you forward and so
  

01:02:29.469   01:02:32.099  
moves away   it guides you forward and so
you     say     at  

01:02:32.099   01:02:32.109  
you say   aiming at
  

01:02:32.109   01:02:34.199  
you say   aiming at 
   that  

01:02:34.199   01:02:34.209  
  paradise itself and the answer to that
  

01:02:34.209   01:02:36.660  
  paradise itself and the answer to that 
   you  

01:02:36.660   01:02:36.670  
  is no because what do you know you you
  

01:02:36.670   01:02:38.309  
  is no because what do you know you you
couldn't     in  

01:02:38.309   01:02:38.319  
couldn't   see paradise if it was right in
  

01:02:38.319   01:02:40.109  
couldn't   see paradise if it was right in
front    glimmer  

01:02:40.109   01:02:40.119  
front   but you might get a glimmer
  

01:02:40.119   01:02:43.049  
front   but you might get a glimmer
of     you  

01:02:43.049   01:02:43.059  
of   it and so you move towards it and you
  

01:02:43.059   01:02:45.449  
of   it and so you move towards it and you
grow     open  

01:02:45.449   01:02:45.459  
grow and then the next time   you open
  

01:02:45.459   01:02:47.189  
grow and then the next time   you open 
   more  

01:02:47.189   01:02:47.199  
   bit more
  

01:02:47.199   01:02:48.989  
   bit more
clearly     that  

01:02:48.989   01:02:48.999  
clearly   and that's what happens is that
  

01:02:48.999   01:02:51.329  
clearly   and that's what happens is that 
   it  

01:02:51.329   01:02:51.339  
  just happens over and over right it
  

01:02:51.339   01:02:56.900  
  just happens over and over right it
keeps     move     this  

01:02:56.900   01:02:56.910  
keeps moving   like this
  

01:02:56.910   01:02:59.219  
keeps moving   like this
but     that's     that  

01:02:59.219   01:02:59.229  
but the thing that's   is that
  

01:02:59.229   01:03:01.410  
but the thing that's   is that
although     each  

01:03:01.410   01:03:01.420  
although zigs and zags you say in each
 

01:03:01.420   01:03:03.329  
although zigs and zags you say in each
of     and    a  

01:03:03.329   01:03:03.339  
of those zags is it and   zigs is a
  

01:03:03.339   01:03:06.150  
of those zags is it and   zigs is a
catastrophe    then  

01:03:06.150   01:03:06.160  
catastrophe   I hit a wall my god and then
  

01:03:06.160   01:03:07.680  
catastrophe   I hit a wall my god and then
I     little     barely  

01:03:07.680   01:03:07.690  
I had to die a little   bit and I barely
  

01:03:07.690   01:03:08.870  
I had to die a little   bit and I barely 
   Phoenix

   Phoenix
  

01:03:08.880   01:03:11.579  
   Phoenix 
   and  

01:03:11.579   01:03:11.589  
   and
  

01:03:11.589   01:03:13.949  
   and
it's     painful     that  

01:03:13.949   01:03:13.959  
it's painful   the thing is is that
  

01:03:13.959   01:03:16.829  
it's painful   the thing is is that

01:03:16.839   01:03:19.829  
   20
miles     you've  

01:03:19.829   01:03:19.839  
miles let's say on that road and you've
 

01:03:19.839   01:03:22.170  
miles let's say on that road and you've
only   moved  

01:03:22.170   01:03:22.180  
only   moved 3 miles forward you've moved
  

01:03:22.180   01:03:24.839  
only   moved 3 miles forward you've moved
three     falling  

01:03:24.839   01:03:24.849  
three miles forward instead   of falling
  

01:03:24.849   01:03:26.489  
three miles forward instead   of falling
backwards    too  

01:03:26.489   01:03:26.499  
backwards   because that's the thing too
  

01:03:26.499   01:03:29.160  
backwards   because that's the thing too
is     you     fall  

01:03:29.160   01:03:29.170  
is that if you   you fall
  

01:03:29.170   01:03:32.309  
is that if you   you fall
backwards     because  

01:03:32.309   01:03:32.319  
backwards   you cannot stand still because
  

01:03:32.319   01:03:34.259  
backwards   you cannot stand still because 
   you  

01:03:34.259   01:03:34.269  
   you if you
  

01:03:34.269   01:03:36.930  
   you if you 
   stasis  

01:03:36.930   01:03:36.940  
  stand still and there's no stasis
  

01:03:36.940   01:03:39.239  
  stand still and there's no stasis
there's     you're  

01:03:39.239   01:03:39.249  
there's   only backwards and so if you're
  

01:03:39.249   01:03:41.729  
there's   only backwards and so if you're
not    then  

01:03:41.729   01:03:41.739  
not   moving backward back forwards then
  

01:03:41.739   01:03:46.729  
not   moving backward back forwards then
you're    more

each transformation   starts to lessen
there's     to

there's not so much   of you that has to
  

01:04:11.980   01:04:16.740  
there's not so much   of you that has to 
   end  

01:04:16.740   01:04:16.750  
  die with every mistake and maybe you end
  

01:04:16.750   01:04:19.290  
  die with every mistake and maybe you end
up     properly  

01:04:19.290   01:04:19.300  
up oriented   at least reasonably properly

   that would have
  

01:04:21.040   01:04:23.490  
   that would have
been     trip     it's  

01:04:23.490   01:04:23.500  
been your trip   right it's
  

01:04:23.500   01:04:25.080  
been your trip   right it's
that     and     than

that   worse than

that   worse than 
   of  

01:04:26.970   01:04:26.980  
  that perhaps there's no shortage of
  

01:04:26.980   01:04:28.470  
  that perhaps there's no shortage of
backtracking     matter  

01:04:28.470   01:04:28.480  
backtracking but it doesn't matter
 

01:04:28.480   01:04:31.670  
backtracking but it doesn't matter
   you  

01:04:31.670   01:04:31.680  
  because as you stumble forward you
  

01:04:31.680   01:04:34.410  
  because as you stumble forward you 
   and  

01:04:34.410   01:04:34.420  
  illuminate and inform yourself and
  

01:04:34.420   01:04:36.360  
  illuminate and inform yourself and
perhaps     world  

01:04:36.360   01:04:36.370  
perhaps that's partly   because the world
  

01:04:36.370   01:04:39.650  
perhaps that's partly   because the world
is     you  

01:04:39.650   01:04:39.660  
is made of information and if   you
  

01:04:39.660   01:04:42.540  
is made of information and if   you
encounter     it  

01:04:42.540   01:04:42.550  
encounter it and tangle with it then it
 

01:04:42.550   01:04:45.030  
encounter it and tangle with it then it
informs     informed 

01:04:45.030   01:04:45.040  
informs you and then you become informed
 

01:04:45.040   01:04:47.280  
informs you and then you become informed
and   then  

01:04:47.280   01:04:47.290  
and   and then
  

01:04:47.290   01:04:53.580  
and   and then
you're     ready     Abraham  

01:04:53.580   01:04:53.590  
you're ready   and so God says to Abraham
  

01:04:53.590   01:04:59.040  
you're ready   and so God says to Abraham 
   I  

01:04:59.040   01:04:59.050  
   thee a great nation and I
  

01:04:59.050   01:05:01.290  
   thee a great nation and I
will     and     great  

01:05:01.290   01:05:01.300  
will bless thee and   thy name great
  

01:05:01.300   01:05:06.750  
will bless thee and   thy name great
and     that's  

01:05:06.750   01:05:06.760  
and thou shalt be a blessing that's
 

01:05:06.760   01:05:08.780  
and thou shalt be a blessing that's
that's     offer 

01:05:08.780   01:05:08.790  
that's a good offer
 

01:05:08.790   01:05:15.600  
that's a good offer
   does  

01:05:15.600   01:05:15.610  
  fundamentally I mean it means what does
  

01:05:15.610   01:05:18.770  
  fundamentally I mean it means what does
it     of  

01:05:18.770   01:05:18.780  
it mean to to be made a great nation of
 

01:05:18.780   01:05:20.940  
it mean to to be made a great nation of
well   do  

01:05:20.940   01:05:20.950  
well   perhaps it has something to do
  

01:05:20.950   01:05:22.620  
well   perhaps it has something to do
directly    I  

01:05:22.620   01:05:22.630  
directly   but I
  

01:05:22.630   01:05:24.450  
directly   but I
don't     it's     is  

01:05:24.450   01:05:24.460  
don't   just that you know is
  

01:05:24.460   01:05:26.610  
don't   just that you know is
if     for     world  

01:05:26.610   01:05:26.620  
if you're a force for   world
  

01:05:26.620   01:05:29.370  
if you're a force for   world
then    if  

01:05:29.370   01:05:29.380  
then   that radiates out from you and if
  

01:05:29.380   01:05:31.530  
then   that radiates out from you and if
you're     say  

01:05:31.530   01:05:31.540

01:08:08.740   01:08:12.220  
would have guessed it   you know and so
it's     low-hanging     because  

01:08:12.220   01:08:12.230  
it's low-hanging   fruits man because
  

01:08:12.230   01:08:13.480  
it's low-hanging   fruits man because
they're     that's     if

  inspiration is also something that 
   well  

01:15:45.979   01:15:45.989  
  happens to you because I ask myself well
  

01:15:45.989   01:15:47.750  
  happens to you because I ask myself well
what's     important     could  

01:15:47.750   01:15:47.760  
what's the   thing I could
  

01:15:47.760   01:15:51.229  
what's the   thing I could
do    to  

01:15:51.229   01:15:51.239  
do   to
  

01:15:51.239   01:15:52.610  
do   to
that     but     decided  

01:15:52.610   01:15:52.620  
that but   because I decided
  

01:15:52.620   01:15:55.100  
that but   because I decided 
   it  

01:15:55.100   01:15:55.110  
   I've decided that I'll do it
  

01:15:55.110   01:15:56.450  
   I've decided that I'll do it
whatever     and     know  

01:15:56.450   01:15:56.460  
whatever it   that I want to know
  

01:15:56.460   01:15:58.580  
whatever it   that I want to know
what     those     but  

01:15:58.580   01:15:58.590  
what it is   decisions but
  

01:15:58.590   01:16:01.850  
what it is   decisions but
but     the  

01:16:01.850   01:16:01.860  
but there's an involuntary aspect to the
 

01:16:01.860   01:16:04.939  
but there's an involuntary aspect to the
sorting     the 

01:16:04.939   01:16:04.949  
sorting that occurs and and that's the
 

01:16:04.949   01:16:06.890  
sorting that occurs and and that's the
   to  

01:16:06.890   01:16:06.900  
  psychological equivalent I suppose to
  

01:16:06.900   01:16:11.180  
  psychological equivalent I suppose to
this     I  

01:16:11.180   01:16:11.190  
this and I guess the sacrifice is when I
 

01:16:11.190   01:16:14.110  
this and I guess the sacrifice is when I
feel     I    that  

01:16:14.110   01:16:14.120  
feel that I   that
  

01:16:14.120   01:16:18.110  
feel that I   that 
   the  

01:16:18.110   01:16:18.120  
   then I don't do the
  

01:16:18.120   01:16:20.000  
   then I don't do the
other     that     and  

01:16:20.000   01:16:20.010  
other   to do and
  

01:16:20.010   01:16:23.360  
other   to do and
that's    the  

01:16:23.360   01:16:23.370  
that's   it's to me it's the
  

01:16:23.370   01:16:25.700  
that's   it's to me it's the
proper     sacrifice     is  

01:16:25.700   01:16:25.710  
proper sacrifice   because my sense is
  

01:16:25.710   01:16:29.000  
proper sacrifice   because my sense is 
   you  

01:16:29.000   01:16:29.010  
   you
  

01:16:29.010   01:16:32.060  
   you
do     want  

01:16:32.060   01:16:32.070  
do what's most important and if I want
 

01:16:32.070   01:16:35.750  
do what's most important and if I want
things     to    because  

01:16:35.750   01:16:35.760  
things to   go properly and I do because
  

01:16:35.760   01:16:37.550  
things to   go properly and I do because
I've     of     going  

01:16:37.550   01:16:37.560  
   things not going
  

01:16:37.560   01:16:39.919  
   things not going 
   properly  

01:16:39.919   01:16:39.929  
   properly
  

01:16:39.929   01:16:45.169  
   properly 
   do  

01:16:45.169   01:16:45.179  
   do
  

01:16:45.179   01:16:48.200  
   do
what's     makes  

01:16:48.200   01:16:48.210  
what's necessary to to do   what makes
  

01:16:48.210   01:16:49.550  
what's necessary to to do   what makes
things     those  

01:16:49.550   01:16:49.560  
things go properly under those
 

01:16:49.560   01:16:55.430  
things go properly under those
circumstances   this  

01:16:55.430   01:16:55.440  
circumstances   and it's partly see this
  

01:16:55.440   01:16:57.110  
circumstances   and it's partly see this
is     and  

01:16:57.110   01:16:57.120  
is partly   why the story of Sodom and
  

01:16:57.120   01:16:59.120  
is partly   why the story of Sodom and 
   Abrahamic  

01:16:59.120   01:16:59.130  
  Gomorrah is embedded in the Abrahamic
  

01:16:59.130   01:17:01.760  
  Gomorrah is embedded in the Abrahamic
stories     an  

01:17:01.760   01:17:01.770  
stories I think   because that's an
  

01:17:01.770   01:17:04.340  
stories I think   because that's an
apocalyptic     go  

01:17:04.340   01:17:04.350  
apocalyptic story right   if things go
  

01:17:04.350   01:17:07.010  
apocalyptic story right   if things go
badly     destroyed  

01:17:07.010   01:17:07.020  
badly enough the whole city   is destroyed
  

01:17:07.020   01:17:11.300  
badly enough the whole city   is destroyed 
   is  

01:17:11.300   01:17:11.310  
   goes badly is
  

01:17:11.310   01:17:12.890  
   goes badly is 
   not  

01:17:12.890   01:17:12.900  
   not
  

01:17:12.900   01:17:16.160  
   not
behave     the  

01:17:16.160   01:17:16.170  
behave properly   and the people in the
  

01:17:16.170   01:17:16.670  
behave properly   and the people in the
city     might  

01:17:16.670   01:17:16.680  
city might
 

01:17:16.680   01:17:19.460  
city might
   behaving  

01:17:19.460   01:17:19.470  
   not behaving
  

01:17:19.470   01:17:21.470  
   not behaving 
   the  

01:17:21.470   01:17:21.480  
  properly then you go and so does the
  

01:17:21.480   01:17:24.110  
  properly then you go and so does the
city    you  

01:17:24.110   01:17:24.120  
city   and maybe you don't want maybe you
  

01:17:24.120   01:17:26.240  
city   and maybe you don't want maybe you
do    want  

01:17:26.240   01:17:26.250  
do   that but maybe you don't want
  

01:17:26.250   01:17:28.040  
do   that but maybe you don't want
that     want     then  

01:17:28.040   01:17:28.050  
that and if you don't   then
  

01:17:28.050   01:17:30.890  
that and if you don't   then
maybe     and     do  

01:17:30.890   01:17:30.900  
maybe and   do
  

01:17:30.900   01:17:32.600  
maybe and   do
things     and     the  

01:17:32.600   01:17:32.610  
things property then it's you and   the

  city if you actually know that then
  

01:17:35.040   01:17:37.310  
  city if you actually know that then
maybe     you     so  

01:17:37.310   01:17:37.320  
maybe that terrifies you   badly enough so
  

01:17:37.320   01:17:38.270  
maybe that terrifies you   badly enough so
that     to     the

   I read and on the
  

01:17:57.320   01:18:00.200  
   I read and on the
catastrophes     the     the  

01:18:00.200   01:18:00.210  
catastrophes in the   Union and the
  

01:18:00.210   01:18:02.450  
catastrophes in the   Union and the
people     who     always  

01:18:02.450   01:18:02.460  
people   studied it most deeply always
  

01:18:02.460   01:18:05.750  
people   studied it most deeply always
came     to     state  

01:18:05.750   01:18:05.760  
came to   the same conclusion the state
  

01:18:05.760   01:18:07.940  
came to   the same conclusion the state 
   individual  

01:18:07.940   01:18:07.950  
  became corrupted because each individual
  

01:18:07.950   01:18:10.550  
  became corrupted because each individual
allowed     or  

01:18:10.550   01:18:10.560  
allowed themselves to be corrupted or
 

01:18:10.560   01:18:13.190  
allowed themselves to be corrupted or
perhaps   the  

01:18:13.190   01:18:13.200  
perhaps   in the
  

01:18:13.200   01:18:14.930  
perhaps   in the
process     corrupted     the  

01:18:14.930   01:18:14.940  
process of being corrupted   and the
  

01:18:14.940   01:18:17.870  
process of being corrupted   and the
consequence     the  

01:18:17.870   01:18:17.880  
consequence of that was the end of the
 

01:18:17.880   01:18:21.260  
consequence of that was the end of the
world   if  

01:18:21.260   01:18:21.270  
world   means is that if
  

01:18:21.270   01:18:23.630  
world   means is that if
you     bring  

01:18:23.630   01:18:23.640  
you   don't behave properly then you bring
  

01:18:23.640   01:18:26.690  
you   don't behave properly then you bring
about     the     you  

01:18:26.690   01:18:26.700  
about   the world and maybe you
  

01:18:26.700   01:18:28.010  
about   the world and maybe you 
   your  

01:18:28.010   01:18:28.020  
  think well that's only the end of your

deceit right which is quite   interesting
and    the  

01:23:31.350   01:23:31.360  
and   I guess it's because if the
  

01:23:31.360   01:23:33.840  
and   I guess it's because if the
overarching     something  

01:23:33.840   01:23:33.850  
overarching   structure is solid something
  

01:23:33.850   01:23:35.490  
overarching   structure is solid something

   like that then
  

01:23:35.500   01:23:39.680  
   like that then
then     to

01:25:41.760   01:25:41.770  
  there are there are intrinsic rules to
  

01:25:41.770   01:25:44.790  
  there are there are intrinsic rules to
the     game     if  

01:25:44.790   01:25:44.800  
the game   human being and if
  

01:25:44.800   01:25:48.030  
the game   human being and if
you     to  

01:25:48.030   01:25:48.040  
you and maybe intrinsic rules   to this to
  

01:25:48.040   01:25:50.850  
you and maybe intrinsic rules   to this to
the     human     you  

01:25:50.850   01:25:50.860  
the   being you
  

01:25:50.860   01:25:53.460  
the   being you
break     those     or  

01:25:53.460   01:25:53.470  
break those   rules consciously or
  

01:25:53.470   01:25:56.520  
break those   rules consciously or
unconsciously    and  

01:25:56.520   01:25:56.530  
unconsciously   and
  

01:25:56.530   01:25:58.830  
unconsciously   and
not     at     peril  

01:25:58.830   01:25:58.840  
not only at   but at the peril
  

01:25:58.840   01:26:00.930  
not only at   but at the peril
of     who  

01:26:00.930   01:26:00.940  
of the state and it doesn't matter who
 

01:26:00.940   01:26:03.060  
of the state and it doesn't matter who
   is  

01:26:03.060   01:26:03.070  
   and so I would say this is
  

01:26:03.070   01:26:05.820  
   and so I would say this is 
   fair  

01:26:05.820   01:26:05.830  
  actually an indication of God being fair
  

01:26:05.830   01:26:08.220  
  actually an indication of God being fair
rather     the  

01:26:08.220   01:26:08.230  
rather than being unfair   because the
  

01:26:08.230   01:26:11.910  
rather than being unfair   because the
rule     not  

01:26:11.910   01:26:11.920  
rule here is   Pharaoh or not
  

01:26:11.920   01:26:13.530  
rule here is   Pharaoh or not
you     else's  

01:26:13.530   01:26:13.540  
  you don't get to take someone else's
  

01:26:13.540   01:26:16.709

wife     excuse     now

again to figure   out okay well I've done
that     that     next

sacrificing my   serious
question    sort  

01:28:37.649   01:28:37.659  
question   well then maybe that's the sort
  

01:28:37.659   01:28:38.669  
question   well then maybe that's the sort
of    ask  

01:28:38.669   01:28:38.679  
of   that people don't ask
  

01:28:38.679   01:28:39.750  
of   that people don't ask 
   the  

01:28:39.750   01:28:39.760  
  because they're afraid of the
  

01:28:39.760   01:28:42.540  
  because they're afraid of the
seriousness     what  

01:28:42.540   01:28:42.550  
  seriousness of the question and and what
  

01:28:42.550   01:28:44.759  
  seriousness of the question and and what
the     do  

01:28:44.759   01:28:44.769  
the   magnitude of the potential answer do
  

01:28:44.769   01:28:46.169  
the   magnitude of the potential answer do
you     should  

01:28:46.169   01:28:46.179  
  you really want to know what you should
  

01:28:46.179   01:28:47.669  
  you really want to know what you should
do     your  

01:28:47.669   01:28:47.679  
do that would   be worth sacrificing your
  

01:28:47.679   01:28:50.339  
do that would   be worth sacrificing your 
   because  

01:28:50.339   01:28:50.349  
   yes because
  

01:28:50.349   01:28:53.129  
   yes because
it's     no  

01:28:53.129   01:28:53.139  
it's worth it   but the answer is also no
  

01:28:53.139   01:28:56.909  
it's worth it   but the answer is also no
because     you  

01:28:56.909   01:28:56.919  
because what   really it's your life you
  

01:28:56.919   01:29:00.659  
because what   really it's your life you
know     wrong     you're  

01:29:00.659   01:29:00.669  
know   and you're
  

01:29:00.669   01:29:04.020  
know   and you're
probably     maybe     doesn't

something   we're always aiming at the
mark     do  

01:32:21.120   01:32:21.130  
mark and which is   of course what you do
  

01:32:21.130   01:32:22.500  
mark and which is   of course what you do
when     to  

01:32:22.500   01:32:22.510  
when you hunt right because you have to
 

01:32:22.510   01:32:24.479  
when you hunt right because you have to
hit     precisely    what  

01:32:24.479   01:32:24.489  
hit the mark precisely   and that's what
  

01:32:24.489   01:32:26.310  
hit the mark precisely   and that's what
we're     that  

01:32:26.310   01:32:26.320  
we're like and so what we're like that

psychologically     at 

01:32:27.810   01:32:27.820  
psychologically we have to aim at
 

01:32:27.820   01:32:29.430  
psychologically we have to aim at
something   and  

01:32:29.430   01:32:29.440  
something   and
  

01:32:29.440   01:32:33.060  
something   and
and    to  

01:32:33.060   01:32:33.070  
and   so to sin is to miss the mark is to
  

01:32:33.070   01:32:36.600  
and   so to sin is to miss the mark is to
is     the     to

is to miss the   bullseye to to fail to
  

01:32:36.610   01:32:40.530  
is to miss the   bullseye to to fail to

take aim to aim badly   gain carelessly or 
   well  

01:32:43.350   01:32:43.360  
   all and that says well
  

01:32:43.360   01:32:47.399  
   all and that says well
that's     of     omission  

01:32:47.399   01:32:47.409  
that's that's   omission

  that's to not do and then to be wicked 
   shouldn't  

01:32:51.660   01:32:51.670  
  is to aim at what you know you shouldn't
  

01:32:51.670   01:32:53.430

renovation because I learned from young
that   something  

01:37:18.830   01:37:18.840  
that   young said this this is something
  

01:37:18.840   01:37:21.200

psychological integration and he looked
beyond     although 

01:37:28.070   01:37:28.080  
beyond Piaget I would say although
 

01:37:28.080   01:37:31.310  
beyond Piaget I would say although
Piaget     looked    a  

01:37:31.310   01:37:31.320  
Piaget looked   very far he said here's a
  

01:37:31.320   01:37:33.950  
Piaget looked   very far he said here's a

rationality   on your emotion together
  

01:37:36.060   01:37:37.760  
rationality   on your emotion together
that's     a     conjunction  

01:37:37.760   01:37:37.770  
that's a   male/female conjunction
  

01:37:37.770   01:37:40.459  
that's a   male/female conjunction
symbolically     speaking     rationality

your rationality   served the same purpose 
   and  

01:37:49.520   01:37:49.530  
  so then you're unified in mind and

  so then you're unified in mind and
spirit     that's     enough  

01:37:51.550   01:37:51.560  
spirit let's say that's   enough

   say  

01:53:13.979   01:53:13.989  
   let's say
  

01:53:13.989   01:53:16.020  
   let's say
unless     sacrifice  

01:53:16.020   01:53:16.030  
unless you make the ultimate   sacrifice
  

01:53:16.030   01:53:18.089  
unless you make the ultimate   sacrifice

01:53:18.089   01:53:18.099  
   finding out
  

01:53:18.099   01:53:20.310  
   finding out 
   that's  

01:53:20.310   01:53:20.320  
   it and so that's
  

01:53:20.320   01:53:22.919  
   it and so that's
the     that's  

01:53:22.919   01:53:22.929  
the   sacrificial act right that's that's
  

01:53:22.929   01:53:28.169  
the   sacrificial act right that's that's
really    to

really   active Abram being called upon to
  

01:53:28.179   01:53:30.179  
really   active Abram being called upon to 
   is  

01:53:30.179   01:53:30.189  
   Isaac and think about that is
  

01:53:30.189   01:53:32.129  
   Isaac and think about that is 
   like  

01:53:32.129   01:53:32.139  
   he's been like
  

01:53:32.139   01:53:35.040  
   he's been like
breaking     to  

01:53:35.040   01:53:35.050  
breaking himself into pieces trying to
 

01:53:35.050   01:53:37.049  
breaking himself into pieces trying to
progress   and  

01:53:37.049   01:53:37.059  
progress   starvation and
  

01:53:37.059   01:53:39.060  
progress   starvation and
tyranny     and     the  

01:53:39.060   01:53:39.070  
tyranny and war and deceit and   the
  

01:53:39.070   01:53:40.830  
tyranny and war and deceit and   the
potential     his     child  

01:53:40.830   01:53:40.840  
potential loss of his   wife and child
  

01:53:40.840   01:53:42.779  
potential loss of his   wife and child
lessness     can  

01:53:42.779   01:53:42.789  
lessness and like everything   that can
  

01:53:42.789   01:53:44.489  
lessness and like everything   that can
really     sense     and  

01:53:44.489   01:53:44.499  
really befall you in some sense   and
  

01:53:44.499   01:53:47.160  
really befall you in some sense   and
finally     he's  

01:53:47.160   01:53:47.170  
finally God   grants him Isaac when he's
  

01:53:47.170   01:53:49.080  
finally God   grants him Isaac when he's
old     Isaac     his  

01:53:49.080   01:53:49.090  
old it's impossible he gets Isaac   his
  

01:53:49.090   01:53:51.120  
old it's impossible he gets Isaac   his
son    is  

01:53:51.120   01:53:51.130  
son   and then what has got to do next is
  

01:53:51.130   01:53:53.009  
son   and then what has got to do next is
say     that     you've  

01:53:53.009   01:53:53.019  
say well you know that   son that you've
  

01:53:53.019   01:53:55.140  
say well you know that   son that you've
been     for     it's  

01:53:55.140   01:53:55.150  
been   so long it's
  

01:53:55.150   01:53:57.569  
been   so long it's 
   what  

01:53:57.569   01:53:57.579  
   what
  

01:53:57.579   01:53:58.200  
   what
you're     of  

01:53:58.200   01:53:58.210  
you're made of
 

01:53:58.210   01:53:59.790  
you're made of
I     him    a  

01:53:59.790   01:53:59.800  
I think you should offer him   up as a
  

01:53:59.800   01:54:02.070  
I think you should offer him   up as a 
   very  

01:54:02.070   01:54:02.080  
  sacrifice and I mean it's a very
  

01:54:02.080   01:54:06.390  
  sacrifice and I mean it's a very
barbaric     sense     in  

01:54:06.390   01:54:06.400  
barbaric   and maybe in
  

01:54:06.400   01:54:09.229

well if you're oriented properly in the

well if you're oriented properly in the
world   few  

02:03:54.009   02:03:54.019  
world   the grace of God allows you a few

necessary mistake something   that
  

02:03:56.119   02:04:02.660  
necessary mistake something   that 
   idea  

02:04:02.660   02:04:02.670  
 
 

02:04:02.670   02:04:05.129  
 
well     is    that  

02:04:05.129   02:04:05.139  
well why not what what is   about that
  

02:04:05.139   02:04:08.339  
well why not what what is   about that 
   isn't  

02:04:08.339   02:04:08.349  
   Abraham and it isn't
  

02:04:08.349   02:04:10.140  
   Abraham and it isn't 
   him  

02:04:10.140   02:04:10.150  
  reasonable to attribute mistakes to him
  

02:04:10.150   02:04:12.330  
  reasonable to attribute mistakes to him
or     at     think  

02:04:12.330   02:04:12.340  
or what is it because at   least I think
  

02:04:12.340   02:04:15.870  
or what is it because at   least I think 
   to  

02:04:15.870   02:04:15.880  
   looking to
  

02:04:15.880   02:04:19.350  
   looking to
get     bad     does  

02:04:19.350   02:04:19.360  
get out   situation and he does
  

02:04:19.360   02:04:21.689  
get out   situation and he does 
   that's  

02:04:21.689   02:04:21.699  
  whatever is the best thing that's
  

02:04:21.699   02:04:24.419  
  whatever is the best thing that's 
   I  

02:04:24.419   02:04:24.429  
   to mention as I
  

02:04:24.429   02:04:26.490  
   to mention as I
said     few  

02:04:26.490   02:04:26.500  
said he does the same trick a few
 

02:04:26.500   02:04:29.550  
said he does the same trick a few
chapters     later    it  

02:04:29.550   02:04:29.560  
chapters later   yeah well maybe maybe it
  

02:04:29.560   02:04:32.189  
chapters later   yeah well maybe maybe it
is     that     a  

02:04:32.189   02:04:32.199  
is the case that   a
  

02:04:32.199   02:04:34.890  
is the case that   a
white     lie     well  

02:04:34.890   02:04:34.900  
white lie   issue you know you say well
  

02:04:34.900   02:04:37.740  
white lie   issue you know you say well
it's     acceptable     say  

02:04:37.740   02:04:37.750  
   I would say
  

02:04:37.750   02:04:39.180  
   I would say
well     with  

02:04:39.180   02:04:39.190  
well the best that you can   come up with
  

02:04:39.190   02:04:41.370  
well the best that you can   come up with 
   mean  

02:04:41.370   02:04:41.380  
   doesn't mean
  

02:04:41.380   02:04:45.319  
   doesn't mean
it's     I  

02:04:45.319   02:04:45.329  
it's it's optimal though right like I
 

02:04:45.329   02:04:48.510  
it's it's optimal though right like I
   because  

02:04:48.510   02:04:48.520  
  I'll give you a foolish example because
  

02:04:48.520   02:04:49.770  
  I'll give you a foolish example because
it's     that     the  

02:04:49.770   02:04:49.780  
it's the best   do at the
  

02:04:49.780   02:04:51.839  
it's the best   do at the 
   a  

02:04:51.839   02:04:51.849  
   if you have a
  

02:04:51.849   02:04:54.120  
   if you have a
loved    make  

02:04:54.120   02:04:54.130  
loved   one who says does this dress make
  

02:04:54.130   02:04:58.470  
loved   one who says does this dress make
me     question  

02:04:58.470   02:04:58.480  
me look fat the   answer to that question
  

02:04:58.480   02:05:00.660  
me look fat the   answer to that question 
   that  

02:05:00.660   02:05:00.670  
   like that
  

02:05:00.670   02:05:02.370  
   like that
that's     answer     right  

02:05:02.370   02:05:02.380  
that's the   right
  

02:05:02.380   02:05:03.810  
that's the   right
because     answer     white  

02:05:03.810   02:05:03.820  
because the other answer   the white
  

02:05:03.820   02:05:06.600  
because the other answer   the white 
   and  

02:05:06.600   02:05:06.610  
  lie I mean at least in this context and
  

02:05:06.610   02:05:09.000  
  lie I mean at least in this context and
that     that     you're  

02:05:09.000   02:05:09.010  
that means that   you're
  

02:05:09.010   02:05:12.510  
that means that   you're
maintaining    contract  

02:05:12.510   02:05:12.520  
maintaining   positive contract
  

02:05:12.520   02:05:14.790  
maintaining   positive contract
between     who's     asking  

02:05:14.790   02:05:14.800  
between you and the person   asking
  

02:05:14.800   02:05:16.379  
between you and the person   asking
the     still  

02:05:16.379   02:05:16.389  
the   question but then you're still
  

02:05:16.389   02:05:18.930  
the   question but then you're still
sacrificing     so  

02:05:18.930   02:05:18.940  
sacrificing the truth within   that so
  

02:05:18.940   02:05:21.450  
sacrificing the truth within   that so 
   your  

02:05:21.450   02:05:21.460  
  your your you're maintaining your
  

02:05:21.460   02:05:23.310  
  your your you're maintaining your 
   truth  

02:05:23.310   02:05:23.320  
   truth
  

02:05:23.320   02:05:25.709  
   truth
but     and  

02:05:25.709   02:05:25.719  
but   sacrificing a lower order truth and
  

02:05:25.719   02:05:27.510  
but   sacrificing a lower order truth and
that     better     reverse  

02:05:27.510   02:05:27.520  
that would be better   reverse
  

02:05:27.520   02:05:30.120  
that would be better   reverse
but     sacrificing  

02:05:30.120   02:05:30.130  
but it's not as good   as not sacrificing
  

02:05:30.130   02:05:32.370  
but it's not as good   as not sacrificing
the     I     if  

02:05:32.370   02:05:32.380  
the truth at all and I   would say that if
  

02:05:32.380   02:05:35.250  
the truth at all and I   would say that if
you're    sometimes  

02:05:35.250   02:05:35.260  
you're   maybe fortunate because sometimes
  

02:05:35.260   02:05:36.689  
you're   maybe fortunate because sometimes
it's     a  

02:05:36.689   02:05:36.699  
it's a matter because you can   be in a
  

02:05:36.699   02:05:38.790  
it's a matter because you can   be in a 
   bad  

02:05:38.790   02:05:38.800  
   your choices are bad
  

02:05:38.800   02:05:41.280  
   your choices are bad 
   that  

02:05:41.280   02:05:41.290  
   like that
  

02:05:41.290   02:05:42.689  
   like that
I've    like  

02:05:42.689   02:05:42.699  
I've   probably been in situations like
  

02:05:42.699   02:05:44.250  
I've   probably been in situations like 
   happening

in front   but I can't help

in front   but I can't help 
   it  

02:05:50.250   02:05:50.260  
  but think that it's more than that it

course is postmodern neo-marxist
indoctrination     only    have  

02:07:19.100   02:07:19.110  
indoctrination not not only   and I have
  

02:07:19.110   02:07:22.969  
indoctrination not not only   and I have
made     someone  

02:07:22.969   02:07:22.979  
made tentative arrangements with someone
 

02:07:22.979   02:07:26.750  
made tentative arrangements with someone
to     for 

02:07:26.750   02:07:26.760  
to finance a advertising campaign for
 

02:07:26.760   02:07:30.830  
to finance a advertising campaign for
   to  

02:07:30.830   02:07:30.840  
  that site and so the goal is well to
  

02:07:30.840   02:07:33.679  
  that site and so the goal is well to
inform     consumer     be  

02:07:33.679   02:07:33.689  
inform the consumer   do you want to be
  

02:07:33.689   02:07:34.819  
inform the consumer   do you want to be 
   be

   do you want to be
  

02:07:34.829   02:07:37.069  
   do you want to be
indoctrinated    able  

02:07:37.069   02:07:37.079  
indoctrinated   and happily you'll be able
  

02:07:37.079   02:07:38.719  
indoctrinated   and happily you'll be able 
   both  

02:07:38.719   02:07:38.729  
   both
  

02:07:38.729   02:07:41.509  
   both
purposes    if  

02:07:41.509   02:07:41.519  
purposes   right because if you want to if
  

02:07:41.519   02:07:46.040  
purposes   right because if you want to if
you     courses  

02:07:46.040   02:07:46.050  
you   want to take the the the courses

that   into oxidation
  

02:07:47.699   02:07:49.699  
that   into oxidation
then     of  

02:07:49.699   02:07:49.709  
then this will give you a way of

02:11:05.179   02:11:05.189  
he's discovered historically but anyways
 

02:11:05.189   02:11:08.149  
he's discovered historically but anyways
we're     going    to  

02:11:08.149   02:11:08.159  
we're going   that probably to
  

02:11:08.159   02:11:09.619  
we're going   that probably to
parents     students  

02:11:09.619   02:11:09.629  
parents and to university students
 

02:11:09.629   02:11:11.179  
parents and to university students
   schools  

02:11:11.179   02:11:11.189  
   to the schools
  

02:11:11.189   02:11:13.689  
   to the schools
because     experience     that  

02:11:13.689   02:11:13.699  
because our experience   has been that
  

02:11:13.699   02:11:15.889  
because our experience   has been that
producing    directly  

02:11:15.889   02:11:15.899  
producing   this sort of material directly
  

02:11:15.899   02:11:17.839  
producing   this sort of material directly
for     better     it's  

02:11:17.839   02:11:17.849  
for individuals works much better   it's
  

02:11:17.849   02:11:19.969  
for individuals works much better   it's
much     efficient     students  

02:11:19.969   02:11:19.979  
much more efficient   and so then students
  

02:11:19.979   02:11:22.669  
much more efficient   and so then students 
   be  

02:11:22.669   02:11:22.679  
   able to or their parents will be
  

02:11:22.679   02:11:24.020  
   able to or their parents will be
able     program     the

able   and the
  

02:11:24.030   02:11:25.819  
able   and the
students     will     to  

02:11:25.819   02:11:25.829  
students will   be able to use it to
  

02:11:25.829   02:11:29.719  
students will   be able to use it to
design     personality     manner

same   thing and additionally I think
there's     factor  

02:12:28.170   02:12:28.180  
  there's a huge motivational factor
  

02:12:28.180   02:12:32.340  
  there's a huge motivational factor
that's     difficult

that's difficult to arm   it's difficult
  

02:12:32.350   02:12:33.900  
that's difficult to arm   it's difficult
to     isolated  

02:12:33.900   02:12:33.910  
  to keep motivated when you're isolated

   is pursuing 
   dress  

02:12:38.220   02:12:38.230  
  the same goal so how would you dress
  

02:12:38.230   02:12:40.650  
  the same goal so how would you dress
though     right     both

02:13:21.100   02:13:23.310  
   and it isn't 
   online  

02:13:23.310   02:13:23.320  
   online
  

02:13:23.320   02:13:26.040  
   online
now     people     are  

02:13:26.040   02:13:26.050  
   to are
  

02:13:26.050   02:13:27.690  
   to are
sophisticated     understand  

02:13:27.690   02:13:27.700  
sophisticated   enough to understand
  

02:13:27.700   02:13:29.820  
sophisticated   enough to understand 
   the

   that the
  

02:13:29.830   02:13:32.940  
   that the
medium     it  

02:13:32.940   02:13:32.950  
medium is   the message and so I think it
  

02:13:32.950   02:13:34.410  
medium is   the message and so I think it
would     mistake     to  

02:13:34.410   02:13:34.420  
would be a mistake   to attempt to
  

02:13:34.420   02:13:37.110  
would be a mistake   to attempt to
duplicate     because  

02:13:37.110   02:13:37.120  
  duplicate the University online because
  

02:13:37.120   02:13:40.110  
  duplicate the University online because 
   we're  

02:13:40.110   02:13:40.120  
  you can't but so what we're
  

02:13:40.120   02:13:41.850  
  you can't but so what we're
concentrating    so  

02:13:41.850   02:13:41.860  
concentrating   on right now is not so
  

02:13:41.860   02:13:44.070  
concentrating   on right now is not so
much     the  

02:13:44.070   02:13:44.080  
much content but infrastructure the
 

02:13:44.080   02:13:46.880  
much content but infrastructure the
question     want    an

question is we want   to set up an

question is we want   to set up an 
   be  

02:13:49.560   02:13:49.570  
   education online that will be
  

02:13:49.570   02:13:51.510  
   education online that will be
autonomously     and  

02:13:51.510   02:13:51.520  
autonomously self-governing and
 

02:13:51.520   02:13:55.110  
autonomously self-governing and
   some  

02:13:55.110   02:13:55.120  
  self-improving and the content in some
  

02:13:55.120   02:13:57.180  
  self-improving and the content in some
sense     not     the  

02:13:57.180   02:13:57.190  
sense were not   the
  

02:13:57.190   02:13:57.510

02:13:57.520   02:13:59.580  
  Khan
and     the     process  

02:13:59.580   02:13:59.590  
and as we   process
  

02:13:59.590   02:14:01.650  
and as we   process
by     good  

02:14:01.650   02:14:01.660  
by which   people who generate good
  

02:14:01.660   02:14:04.110  
by which   people who generate good
content     and  

02:14:04.110   02:14:04.120  
content might be optimally rewarded   and
  

02:14:04.120   02:14:06.150  
content might be optimally rewarded   and
that's     and  

02:14:06.150   02:14:06.160  
that's what we want   to get right and
  

02:14:06.160   02:14:08.190  
that's what we want   to get right and
that's     discussion     that'll  

02:14:08.190   02:14:08.200  
that's probably   that'll
  

02:14:08.200   02:14:11.370  
that's probably   that'll
take     out  

02:14:11.370   02:14:11.380  
take a   year or two years to to flesh out
  

02:14:11.380   02:14:14.670  
take a   year or two years to to flesh out
we     started     the  

02:14:14.670   02:14:14.680  
we started   the
  

02:14:14.680   02:14:17.100  
we started   the
system     your  

02:14:17.100   02:14:17.110  
system might   look like but but to your
  

02:14:17.110   02:14:17.700  
system might   look like but but to your
point 

02:14:17.700   02:14:17.710  
point
 

02:14:17.710   02:14:21.600  
point
it     we're    and  

02:14:21.600   02:14:21.610  
it isn't we're   not taking lectures and
  

02:14:21.610   02:14:23.370  
it isn't we're   not taking lectures and
putting     although     obviously  

02:14:23.370   02:14:23.380  
putting them   obviously
  

02:14:23.380   02:14:25.470  
putting them   obviously
that's     that     isn't  

02:14:25.470   02:14:25.480  
that's what I'm doing that that   isn't
  

02:14:25.480   02:14:27.120  
that's what I'm doing that that   isn't
going     humanities

going   to make an online humanities
  

02:14:27.130   02:14:29.310  
going   to make an online humanities

   odd to begin
with     then     at  

02:15:54.720   02:15:54.730  
with   went and looked at
  

02:15:54.730   02:15:56.250

   was real but even more importantly
  

02:16:01.930   02:16:03.270  
   was real but even more importantly
there     knowing     it  

02:16:03.270   02:16:03.280  
there was no way of   whether it
  

02:16:03.280   02:16:04.950  
there was no way of   whether it
was     or     had  

02:16:04.950   02:16:04.960  
was true or   false because the system had
  

02:16:04.960   02:16:07.500  
was true or   false because the system had
never     what  

02:16:07.500   02:16:07.510  
never been set up   to calculate what

  actually went to the recipients of
social     and     then  

02:16:13.380   02:16:13.390  
   then
  

02:16:13.390   02:16:14.730  
   then
I     thought     at  

02:16:14.730   02:16:14.740  
   at
  

02:16:14.740   02:16:17.520

wasn't     cynical     it's  

02:16:25.530   02:16:25.540  
wasn't   about that it's
  

02:16:25.540   02:16:27.390  
wasn't   about that it's
like     charity     know  

02:16:27.390   02:16:27.400  
like charity   most charities you know
  

02:16:27.400   02:16:30.090  
like charity   most charities you know
it's     like     the  

02:16:30.090   02:16:30.100  
it's like   overhead so what is the

it's like   overhead so what is the 
   don't  

02:16:33.959   02:16:33.969  
   don't
  

02:16:33.969   02:16:35.190  
   don't
want     to     because

maintaining     itself    makes  

02:16:45.330   02:16:45.340  
maintaining itself   you know and it makes
  

02:16:45.340   02:16:46.800  
maintaining itself   you know and it makes 
   of  

02:16:46.800   02:16:46.810  
   it makes a bit of
  

02:16:46.810   02:16:48.300  
   it makes a bit of 
   is  

02:16:48.300   02:16:48.310  
   does is
  

02:16:48.310   02:16:51.360  
   does is 
   anyways  

02:16:51.360   02:16:51.370  
   so anyways
  

02:16:51.370   02:16:54.000  
   so anyways
one     was  

02:16:54.000   02:16:54.010  
one of the   axioms in that book that was
  

02:16:54.010   02:16:55.440  
one of the   axioms in that book that was
one     of     do  

02:16:55.440   02:16:55.450  
one of   them is the system does not do
  

02:16:55.450   02:16:58.200  
one of   them is the system does not do
what    you  

02:16:58.200   02:16:58.210  
what   so that's then you
  

02:16:58.210   02:16:59.610  
what   so that's then you
can     head  

02:16:59.610   02:16:59.620  
can face the system with a clear head
 

02:16:59.620   02:17:02.580  
can face the system with a clear head
   doing  

02:17:02.580   02:17:02.590  
   okay well this thing isn't doing
  

02:17:02.590   02:17:03.810  
   okay well this thing isn't doing
what     doing     it's  

02:17:03.810   02:17:03.820  
what it says it's doing   it's
  

02:17:03.820   02:17:05.370  
what it says it's doing   it's
probably     something     thing  

02:17:05.370   02:17:05.380  
   and the thing
  

02:17:05.380   02:17:07.020  
   and the thing 
   should  

02:17:07.020   02:17:07.030  
   useful but we should
  

02:17:07.030   02:17:08.370  
   useful but we should
figure     out     that's  

02:17:08.370   02:17:08.380  
figure out   is so that's
  

02:17:08.380   02:17:09.959  
figure out   is so that's
been     useful     to  

02:17:09.959   02:17:09.969  
been   to me as a guide to
  

02:17:09.969   02:17:12.060  
been   to me as a guide to 
   if  

02:17:12.060   02:17:12.070  
   said was if
  

02:17:12.070   02:17:13.830  
   said was if
you     to     that  

02:17:13.830   02:17:13.840  
you want to   build a big system that
  

02:17:13.840   02:17:15.570  
you want to   build a big system that
works     small  

02:17:15.570   02:17:15.580  
works start with by building a small
 

02:17:15.580   02:17:18.180  
works start with by building a small
system     works    we've  

02:17:18.180   02:17:18.190  
system that works   and scale it and we've
  

02:17:18.190   02:17:19.740  
system that works   and scale it and we've
done    self  

02:17:19.740   02:17:19.750  
done   with the self
  

02:17:19.750   02:17:21.300  
done   with the self
authoring     know     built  

02:17:21.300   02:17:21.310  
authoring programs you know   has built
  

02:17:21.310   02:17:23.310  
authoring programs you know   has built 
   robust  

02:17:23.310   02:17:23.320  
  small scale systems that are very robust
  

02:17:23.320   02:17:25.379  
  small scale systems that are very robust
with     and  

02:17:25.379   02:17:25.389  
  with the hope that they'll scale and
  

02:17:25.389   02:17:26.550  
  with the hope that they'll scale and
that's     same     thing  

02:17:26.550   02:17:26.560  
that's   thing
  

02:17:26.560   02:17:30.300  
that's   thing 
   of  

02:17:30.300   02:17:30.310  
  here is start with a small amount of
  

02:17:30.310   02:17:33.390  
  here is start with a small amount of
content    I  

02:17:33.390   02:17:33.400  
content   see what I
  

02:17:33.400   02:17:35.040  
content   see what I 
   know  

02:17:35.040   02:17:35.050  
  would like to have happen is you know
  

02:17:35.050   02:17:36.209  
  would like to have happen is you know
there's     of     who  

02:17:36.209   02:17:36.219  
there's a lot of   who
  

02:17:36.219   02:17:38.400  
there's a lot of   who
are     some  

02:17:38.400   02:17:38.410  
are pretty intensely educated and some
 

02:17:38.410   02:17:40.320  
are pretty intensely educated and some
of     really    so  

02:17:40.320   02:17:40.330  
of them are really   creative and so
  

02:17:40.330   02:17:42.720  
of them are really   creative and so 
   imagine  

02:17:42.720   02:17:42.730  
   timeline imagine
  

02:17:42.730   02:17:44.520  
   timeline imagine
you    you  

02:17:44.520   02:17:44.530  
you   could do a humanity since you
  

02:17:44.530   02:17:46.290  
you   could do a humanity since you
imagine     a  

02:17:46.290   02:17:46.300  
imagine there's a timeline   say of a
  

02:17:46.300   02:17:49.620  
imagine there's a timeline   say of a
thousand     imagine  

02:17:49.620   02:17:49.630  
thousand   years but scalable then imagine
  

02:17:49.630   02:17:51.810  
thousand   years but scalable then imagine
that     lectures  

02:17:51.810   02:17:51.820  
that that there would be lectures
 

02:17:51.820   02:17:53.550  
that that there would be lectures
associated     at 

02:17:53.550   02:17:53.560  
associated with the timeline at
 

02:17:53.560   02:17:55.379  
associated with the timeline at
different     resolution    we  

02:17:55.379   02:17:55.389  
different levels of resolution   so we
  

02:17:55.389   02:17:58.260  
different levels of resolution   so we
might     on     3rd  

02:17:58.260   02:17:58.270  
might call for   the 3rd
  

02:17:58.270   02:18:01.080  
might call for   the 3rd
century    3rd  

02:18:01.080   02:18:01.090  
century   what happened in the 3rd
  

02:18:01.090   02:18:02.790  
century   what happened in the 3rd
century    to  

02:18:02.790   02:18:02.800  
century   hour to
  

02:18:02.800   02:18:04.709  
century   hour to
explain     way  

02:18:04.709   02:18:04.719  
explain it   you can explain it any way
  

02:18:04.719   02:18:06.839  
explain it   you can explain it any way
you    can  

02:18:06.839   02:18:06.849  
you   use animation you can
  

02:18:06.849   02:18:08.820  
you   use animation you can
use     lecture     can  

02:18:08.820   02:18:08.830  
use lecture   you can
  

02:18:08.830   02:18:11.070  
use lecture   you can
make     you     have  

02:18:11.070   02:18:11.080  
make a movie   have
  

02:18:11.080   02:18:13.350  
make a movie   have
to     is     the  

02:18:13.350   02:18:13.360  
   that's the
  

02:18:13.360   02:18:15.450  
   that's the 
   and  

02:18:15.450   02:18:15.460  
   that's the amount of time and
  

02:18:15.460   02:18:18.150  
   that's the amount of time and
then     you     could  

02:18:18.150   02:18:18.160  
then you   and so we could
  

02:18:18.160   02:18:20.250  
then you   and so we could 
   people  

02:18:20.250   02:18:20.260  
   people
  

02:18:20.260   02:18:22.700  
   people
experiment     people  

02:18:22.700   02:18:22.710  
experiment and then we can have   people
  

02:18:22.710   02:18:25.890  
experiment and then we can have   people
review     of     their  

02:18:25.890   02:18:25.900  
review the content as part of   their
  

02:18:25.900   02:18:28.320  
review the content as part of   their
generate     the     as

generate   content as
  

02:18:28.330   02:18:30.420  
generate   content as
part     assignments     the  

02:18:30.420   02:18:30.430  
part of their assignments   rate the
  

02:18:30.430   02:18:32.190  
part of their assignments   rate the

questions as part   of their assignments
  

02:18:32.200   02:18:35.040  
questions as part   of their assignments 
   we  

02:18:35.040   02:18:35.050  
  and rate the content and then if we
  

02:18:35.050   02:18:37.470  
  and rate the content and then if we
charge     $50  

02:18:37.470   02:18:37.480  
charge people imagine you had to   pay $50
  

02:18:37.480   02:18:39.090  
charge people imagine you had to   pay $50
a     that  

02:18:39.090   02:18:39.100  
a month   to enroll something like that
  

02:18:39.100   02:18:42.690  
a month   to enroll something like that
maybe     first  

02:18:42.690   02:18:42.700  
  maybe we would allow you when you first
  

02:18:42.700   02:18:46.230  
  maybe we would allow you when you first
enroll     dollars  

02:18:46.230   02:18:46.240  
enroll maybe you get to use   five dollars
  

02:18:46.240   02:18:48.150  
enroll maybe you get to use   five dollars
of     can  

02:18:48.150   02:18:48.160  
of it as disposable income you can
 

02:18:48.160   02:18:50.070  
of it as disposable income you can
reward   but  

02:18:50.070   02:18:50.080  
reward   that to any creator you want but
  

02:18:50.080   02:18:52.440  
reward   that to any creator you want but
as     through     your  

02:18:52.440   02:18:52.450  
as you progress through   your
  

02:18:52.450   02:18:54.720  
as you progress through   your

would increase as you became more   and
  

02:18:57.310   02:18:58.950  
would increase as you became more   and
more     we  

02:18:58.950   02:18:58.960  
more educated   hopefully that way we
  

02:18:58.960   02:19:00.360  
more educated   hopefully that way we
would     built  

02:19:00.360   02:19:00.370  
would get some   quality control built
  

02:19:00.370   02:19:02.160  
would get some   quality control built
into     so     ideas  

02:19:02.160   02:19:02.170  
into it so   of the ideas
  

02:19:02.170   02:19:03.810  
into it so   of the ideas
that     play  

02:19:03.810   02:19:03.820  
that were that we're starting   to play
  

02:19:03.820   02:19:06.720  
that were that we're starting   to play
around     I'm     consider  

02:19:06.720   02:19:06.730  
   consider
  

02:19:06.730   02:19:08.400  
   consider 
   that  

02:19:08.400   02:19:08.410  
  about is the motivation yeah what's that
  

02:19:08.410   02:19:11.060  
  about is the motivation yeah what's that 
   individuals  

02:19:11.060   02:19:11.070  
   issue for individuals
  

02:19:11.070   02:19:14.700  
   issue for individuals
well     not     that  

02:19:14.700   02:19:14.710  
well then I'm not   that
  

02:19:14.710   02:19:16.980  
well then I'm not   that
because    but  

02:19:16.980   02:19:16.990  
because   too long but but
  

02:19:16.990   02:19:18.630  
because   too long but but
rest     are     about  

02:19:18.630   02:19:18.640  
rest assured   thinking about
  

02:19:18.640   02:19:20.640  
rest assured   thinking about 
   to  

02:19:20.640   02:19:20.650  
  that very hard as well we're going to
  

02:19:20.650   02:19:22.590  
  that very hard as well we're going to
build     going     to  

02:19:22.590   02:19:22.600  
   to
  

02:19:22.600   02:19:24.330  
   to 
   to  

02:19:24.330   02:19:24.340  
  build cooperation into it we hope to
  

02:19:24.340   02:19:26.730  
  build cooperation into it we hope to
build     I  

02:19:26.730   02:19:26.740  
build peer   into relationships into it I
  

02:19:26.740   02:19:28.770  
build peer   into relationships into it I
think     that's     but  

02:19:28.770   02:19:28.780  
think all   possible but but
  

02:19:28.780   02:19:30.870  
think all   possible but but
complex    know  

02:19:30.870   02:19:30.880  
complex   right because it's we don't know
  

02:19:30.880   02:19:34.050  
complex   right because it's we don't know
how     system

how   to build an online education system
  

02:19:34.060   02:19:36.330  
how   to build an online education system
really     fun     to  

02:19:36.330   02:19:36.340  
really   to
  

02:19:36.340   02:19:37.740  
really   to
experiment    out  

02:19:37.740   02:19:37.750  
experiment   if we can figure out
  

02:19:37.750   02:19:48.720  
experiment   if we can figure out
how    I  

02:19:48.720   02:19:48.730  
how   so I I
  

02:19:48.730   02:19:51.390  
how   so I I
couldn't     any

Cricket     from  

02:20:56.760   02:20:56.770  
Cricket different from Christ apart from
 

02:20:56.770   02:20:58.290  
Cricket different from Christ apart from
the     that    is  

02:20:58.290   02:20:58.300  
the fact that   Christ wasn't a cricket is
  

02:20:58.300   02:21:01.650  
the fact that   Christ wasn't a cricket is
that     he  

02:21:01.650   02:21:01.660  
that Craig the cricket learns as he
 

02:21:01.660   02:21:03.630  
that Craig the cricket learns as he
   the  

02:21:03.630   02:21:03.640  
  progresses right even though he's the
  

02:21:03.640   02:21:05.580  
  progresses right even though he's the
conscience     he  

02:21:05.580   02:21:05.590  
conscience   and so you'd think that he
  

02:21:05.590   02:21:07.740  
conscience   and so you'd think that he
would     isn't  

02:21:07.740   02:21:07.750  
would be   the infallible guide that isn't
  

02:21:07.750   02:21:09.150  
would be   the infallible guide that isn't
how     the     so  

02:21:09.150   02:21:09.160  
how the   set it up but not so
  

02:21:09.160   02:21:12.090  
how the   set it up but not so 
   muddle-headed  

02:21:12.090   02:21:12.100  
   just as muddle-headed
  

02:21:12.100   02:21:14.160  
   just as muddle-headed
as     a  

02:21:14.160   02:21:14.170  
as Pinocchio at the beginning and he's a
 

02:21:14.170   02:21:17.580  
as Pinocchio at the beginning and he's a
bit   it  

02:21:17.580   02:21:17.590  
bit   too and so it
  

02:21:17.590   02:21:19.080  
bit   too and so it
took     me     that  

02:21:19.080   02:21:19.090  
took   that
  

02:21:19.090   02:21:20.550  
took   that
through    well  

02:21:20.550   02:21:20.560  
through   that well
  

02:21:20.560   02:21:24.000  
through   that well
you     the  

02:21:24.000   02:21:24.010  
you you have the voice of you have the
 

02:21:24.010   02:21:26.070  
you you have the voice of you have the
voice     you    the  

02:21:26.070   02:21:26.080  
voice of culture in you   you have the
  

02:21:26.080   02:21:28.889  
voice of culture in you   you have the
voice     old  

02:21:28.889   02:21:28.899  
voice of culture within   you but it's old
  

02:21:28.899   02:21:30.690  
voice of culture within   you but it's old
and     and     not  

02:21:30.690   02:21:30.700  
and dead and   it's not
  

02:21:30.700   02:21:33.599  
and dead and   it's not
fully     and     then  

02:21:33.599   02:21:33.609  
fully articulated and updated and   then
  

02:21:33.609   02:21:35.280  
fully articulated and updated and   then
what     is     a  

02:21:35.280   02:21:35.290  
what happens is   enter into a
  

02:21:35.290   02:21:38.730  
what happens is   enter into a
dialogue     yourself  

02:21:38.730   02:21:38.740  
dialogue with it   and you hammer yourself
  

02:21:38.740   02:21:40.889  
dialogue with it   and you hammer yourself
against     hammered  

02:21:40.889   02:21:40.899  
against the world   then you get hammered
  

02:21:40.899   02:21:42.750  
against the world   then you get hammered 
   conscience  

02:21:42.750   02:21:42.760  
   and so does your conscience
  

02:21:42.760   02:21:46.200  
   and so does your conscience 
   so  

02:21:46.200   02:21:46.210  
  and so you both become elevated and so
  

02:21:46.210   02:21:49.110  
  and so you both become elevated and so
well    that's  

02:21:49.110   02:21:49.120  
well   so anyways I think that's that's
  

02:21:49.120   02:21:51.120  
well   so anyways I think that's that's
ridiculously     that  

02:21:51.120   02:21:51.130  
ridiculously cool because it means that
 

02:21:51.130   02:21:52.980  
ridiculously cool because it means that
your     conscience    an  

02:21:52.980   02:21:52.990  
your conscience   you don't have an
  

02:21:52.990   02:21:54.450  
your conscience   you don't have an
infallible     something  

02:21:54.450   02:21:54.460  
infallible guide but you have something
 

02:21:54.460   02:21:56.099  
infallible guide but you have something
   an  

02:21:56.099   02:21:56.109  
   you could build into an
  

02:21:56.109   02:21:58.349  
   you could build into an
infallible     with  

02:21:58.349   02:21:58.359  
infallible guide if   you cooperated with
  

02:21:58.359   02:22:02.429  
infallible guide if   you cooperated with
it     well     think  

02:22:02.429   02:22:02.439  
it and and said it so well   think
  

02:22:02.439   02:22:04.530  
it and and said it so well   think
that's    being  

02:22:04.530   02:22:04.540  
that's   very interesting so that being
  

02:22:04.540   02:22:06.929  
that's   very interesting so that being
said     my  

02:22:06.929   02:22:06.939  
said yes the picture that   I have in my
  

02:22:06.939   02:22:09.450  
said yes the picture that   I have in my
mind     of     in  

02:22:09.450   02:22:09.460  
mind   cultivation of virtue in
  

02:22:09.460   02:22:12.240  
mind   cultivation of virtue in
general    block  

02:22:12.240   02:22:12.250  
general   it's kind of like taking a block
  

02:22:12.250   02:22:13.710  
general   it's kind of like taking a block
of     wood     sphere  

02:22:13.710   02:22:13.720  
of wood   out a sphere
  

02:22:13.720   02:22:16.200  
of wood   out a sphere 
   round  

02:22:16.200   02:22:16.210  
   of it it'll never be perfectly round
  

02:22:16.210   02:22:18.150  
   of it it'll never be perfectly round
but     rounder  

02:22:18.150   02:22:18.160  
but the more you carve right the rounder
 

02:22:18.160   02:22:20.190  
but the more you carve right the rounder
and     successive 

02:22:20.190   02:22:20.200  
and rounder right that's successive
 

02:22:20.200   02:22:22.830  
and rounder right that's successive
approximation   also  

02:22:22.830   02:22:22.840  
approximation   yeah well one of it's also
  

02:22:22.840   02:22:25.800  
approximation   yeah well one of it's also
like     do     compound

successive approximation is you don't
want     of

want to underestimate the utility of

incremental     progress    really  

02:23:05.940   02:23:05.950

kids     you  

02:23:09.841   02:23:09.851  
kids deadly powerful so so let's say you
 

02:23:09.851   02:23:12.570  
kids deadly powerful so so let's say you
get   of  

02:23:12.570   02:23:12.580  
get   know the higher ends of
  

02:23:12.580   02:23:14.341  
get   know the higher ends of
the     pretty  

02:23:14.341   02:23:14.351  
the curve   right you're like a pretty
  

02:23:14.351   02:23:16.980  
the curve   right you're like a pretty
virtuous     person     even  

02:23:16.980   02:23:16.990  
virtuous person   let's say you even
  

02:23:16.990   02:23:19.291  
virtuous person   let's say you even 
   sort  

02:23:19.291   02:23:19.301  
   or something of the sort
  

02:23:19.301   02:23:25.051  
   or something of the sort
and     doubt     your  

02:23:25.051   02:23:25.061  
and I mean one should you doubt   your
  

02:23:25.061   02:23:27.690  
and I mean one should you doubt   your
conscience     what     we  

02:23:27.690   02:23:27.700  
conscience   are things that we
  

02:23:27.700   02:23:29.430  
conscience   are things that we 
   got  

02:23:29.430   02:23:29.440  
   when we got
  

02:23:29.440   02:23:30.180  
   when we got
great

  well that's yep okay um just just to get
  

02:23:33.730   02:23:36.450  
  well that's yep okay um just just to get
it     out     don't  

02:23:36.450   02:23:36.460  
   I don't

02:23:39.150   02:23:39.160  
   much this relates well it does
  

02:23:39.160   02:23:41.940  
   much this relates well it does
relate     the  

02:23:41.940   02:23:41.950  
relate but   Psychopaths for example the
  

02:23:41.950   02:23:43.921  
relate but   Psychopaths for example the
entire     lack     conscience  

02:23:43.921   02:23:43.931  
entire idea   conscience
  

02:23:43.931   02:23:46.020  
entire idea   conscience
and     right     what  

02:23:46.020   02:23:46.030  
and that's why right   that's what
  

02:23:46.030   02:23:49.140  
and that's why right   that's what
psychopathy     or     agree  

02:23:49.140   02:23:49.150  
psychopathy is whether or   not you agree
  

02:23:49.150   02:23:51.421  
psychopathy is whether or   not you agree 
   there's  

02:23:51.421   02:23:51.431  
   definition right but there's
  

02:23:51.431   02:23:53.700  
   definition right but there's
an     with  

02:23:53.700   02:23:53.710  
an issue of   conscience again a play with
  

02:23:53.710   02:23:57.990  
an issue of   conscience again a play with
psychopathy    first  

02:23:57.990   02:23:58.000  
psychopathy   first
  

02:23:58.000   02:24:01.860

question     ourselves     that's  

02:24:01.860   02:24:01.870  
question doubt ourselves   in a way that's
  

02:24:01.870   02:24:03.631  
question doubt ourselves   in a way that's
warranted    how

warranted   of how
  

02:24:03.641   02:24:09.120

virtuous     treat  

02:24:09.120   02:24:09.130  
virtuous we've become and can you treat

virtuous we've become and can you treat
   a  

02:24:11.100   02:24:11.110  
   could they call fate a

   could they call fate a
conscience     with  

02:24:13.410   02:24:13.420  
conscience   okay so let we'll start with
  

02:24:13.420   02:24:15.360  
conscience   okay so let we'll start with
the     first     that  

02:24:15.360   02:24:15.370  
the first   one part of the reason that
  

02:24:15.370   02:24:18.690  
the first   one part of the reason that
that     believe     is

neuroticism so you can't frighten them
but     that's    because

but so that's   a rare combination because
  

02:28:49.360   02:28:51.690  
but so that's   a rare combination because
it's     but
