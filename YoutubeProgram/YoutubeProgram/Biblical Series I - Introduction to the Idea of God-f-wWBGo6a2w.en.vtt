 [CLASSICAL MUSIC] 

00:00:09.340   00:00:29.020
 [applause] 

00:00:29.100   00:00:32.300
 Thank you very much for all that you have come. 

00:00:32.300   00:00:37.900
 It is really shocking to me that you have nothing better to do on Tuesday night. [PUBLIC LIFE] 

00:00:38.800   00:00:40.960
 No, but seriously, it is. 

00:00:40.960   00:00:52.240
 I mean, in a sense, it is very strange that you have so much here to listen to a series of lectures on the psychological meaning of biblical stories. 

00:00:52.320   00:01:02.120
 That's something I wanted to do for a long time, but I'm still surprised that there is a ready audience for that. 

00:01:03.220   00:01:07.440
 That's good, so we'll see how it goes. 

00:01:08.920   00:01:11.280
 I'll start with this because this is the right question. 

00:01:11.280   00:01:13.720
 The right question is why to try. 

00:01:13.720   00:01:16.380
 And I do not think why I should try. 

00:01:16.520   00:01:23.740
 I have my reasons for that, but maybe you think so why worry about this strange old book anyway? 

00:01:24.500   00:01:25.000
 AND... 

00:01:28.180   00:01:29.480
 That's a good question. 

00:01:29.760   00:01:30.260
 You know, 

00:01:30.480   00:01:30.980
 Umm 

00:01:32.700   00:01:34.340
 Contradictory is ... 

00:01:35.800   00:01:39.300
 a document that has been compiled for thousands of years. 

00:01:39.320   00:01:42.900
 The book has survived the kingdoms, many, many kingdoms, do you know? 

00:01:43.080   00:01:48.040
 Interestingly, the book is more durable than stone. 

00:01:48.040   00:01:49.540
 It's more durable than a castle. 

00:01:49.540   00:01:51.060
 Permanence is from the empire. 

00:01:51.400   00:01:53.560
 And that's really interesting. 

00:01:54.180   00:01:59.380
 If something, in a sense, so short-lived, can live so long. 

00:02:00.620   00:02:02.920
 So that's a kind of secret. 

00:02:03.040   00:02:10.660
 I approach this scenario, these biblical stories seem to be actually a secret, basically. 

00:02:10.660   00:02:14.040
 Because they are, we do not understand much about them. 

00:02:14.040   00:02:19.800
 We do not understand what happened. We do not really understand how they came about. 

00:02:20.520   00:02:25.420
 We do not understand why they had an incredible impact on civilization. 

00:02:25.820   00:02:28.600
 We do not understand how people could trust them. 

00:02:28.920   00:02:34.520
 We do not understand what this means, we do not believe in them now, and even what it would mean if they trusted them. 

00:02:34.520   00:02:44.780
 And then, above all, there is an additional problem that is not specific to me, but it is certainly relevant to me. 

00:02:44.780   00:02:52.940
 that no matter how educated you are not educated enough to discuss the psychological meaning of biblical stories. 

00:02:53.240   00:02:56.080
 But I will do my best. 

00:02:57.200   00:03:05.860
 Partly because I want to find out more about them, and one of the things I've learned is that the best way to find out something is to talk about it. 

00:03:05.860   00:03:12.020
 And when I submit, I mean, you know, I'm not trying to tell you that what I know must be the case. 

00:03:12.020   00:03:15.380
 Because there are a lot of things I do not know. 

00:03:15.380   00:03:17.600
 I'm trying to get the sense out of this. 

00:03:17.600   00:03:19.920
 I've been doing this for a long time. 

00:03:20.780   00:03:23.600
 Now, maybe you know, maybe not, 

00:03:24.460   00:03:26.260
 I am a fan of Nietzsche. 

00:03:27.440   00:03:32.560
 Nietzsche was a devastating critic, I would say, dogmatic Christianity. 

00:03:32.600   00:03:36.280
 Christianity as it has been appropriate in institutions. 

00:03:36.280   00:03:39.900
 By contrast ... although he is a very paradoxical thinker. 

00:03:40.000   00:03:47.680
 For example, one of the things Nietzsche said was that he did not believe that the scientific revolution could ever be revived 

00:03:48.240   00:03:50.100
 If there was no Christianity. 

00:03:50.120   00:03:58.200
 More specifically, for Catholicism, because he believed that during a really, a thousand years, 

00:03:59.400   00:04:11.700
 The European mind, so to speak, had to be trained to interpret everything known in a single context. 

00:04:12.080   00:04:14.660
 Related to accepting initial facts. 

00:04:14.800   00:04:16.680
 The only coherent framework. 

00:04:16.820   00:04:30.700
 Thus Nietzsche believes that Catholicism has produced the kind of mind that could then overcome its dogmatic foundations 

00:04:30.700   00:04:32.740
 then concentrate on something else. 

00:04:32.740   00:04:35.780
 What in this particular case was - a natural world. 

00:04:35.940   00:04:46.820
 And so Nietzsche believed that, in a sense, Christianity had died from his own hands, and had spent a long time trying to align people with the need for truth. 

00:04:47.660   00:04:52.220
 Absent corruption and all this, it is always part of any human endeavor. 

00:04:52.620   00:04:58.900
 And then the truth, the spirit of truth that has developed Christianity turned the roots of Christianity. 

00:04:58.900   00:05:04.700
 And everyone woke up and said or thought something like, "So how did we come to believe in any of this?" 

00:05:06.340   00:05:11.220
 It's like you wake up one day and notice that you really do not know why you put a Christmas tree. 

00:05:11.220   00:05:17.880
 You've been doing this a long time, and that's what people do, you know, and there are reasons why Christmas trees have come. 

00:05:18.980   00:05:25.160
 But the ritual lasts long after the reasons are forgotten. 

00:05:25.660   00:05:38.160
 So now Nietzsche, though a Christian critic, and also a champion of Christian discipline, because you see, another thing Nietzsche believed 

00:05:38.200   00:05:44.280
 in a sense it can not be free unless you were slaves. 

00:05:44.600   00:05:51.440
 That's what you mean by not going from childhood to a full-grown adult. 

00:05:51.980   00:05:58.180
 From childhood, go to the state of discipline that you might think is similar to slavery, 

00:05:58.680   00:06:06.640
 In self-imposed slavery, that would be the best scenario where you've been disciplined to become something specific, 

00:06:06.780   00:06:11.820
 before you can re-realize the generality you had as a child. 

00:06:12.660   00:06:18.180
 And he believed that Christianity played that role for Western civilization. 

00:06:18.660   00:06:23.800
 But in the late 1800s, he announced that God was dead. 

00:06:24.320   00:06:29.380
 You often hear it as something triumphant. 

00:06:30.000   00:06:35.780
 But for Nietzsche, that was not so, because he was too deep thinker that it would be so easy 

00:06:35.780   00:06:41.140
 You see, Nietzsche understood that, that's something I'll try to explain 

00:06:44.960   00:06:51.780
 there is a large amount we do not know about the structure of experience that we do not know about reality. 

00:06:51.940   00:06:59.940
 And we have articulated views of the world, and beyond, there are things we absolutely do not know. 

00:06:59.940   00:07:01.920
 And there is a buffer zone between them. 

00:07:01.920   00:07:04.600
 And that is something we know something about. 

00:07:04.700   00:07:07.020
 We do not know them in an articulated way, here are examples. 

00:07:07.020   00:07:12.640
 You know, sometimes you're talking to someone close and he / she is in a bad mood, you know? 

00:07:12.840   00:07:17.960
 And they are sensitive and unreasonable, and you still keep talking. 

00:07:18.060   00:07:21.520
 And maybe suddenly angry, or maybe weird. 

00:07:21.760   00:07:28.620
 And then, when they get tired, you realize why they are angry and that it has nothing to do with you, though you might have been the one who pointed out this argument. 

00:07:28.980   00:07:37.740
 And this is an interesting occurrence as far as I am concerned, because that means that people can know things on one level, and that they can not speak what they know in the other. 

00:07:37.940   00:07:44.940
 So, in a sense, thoughts arise from the body, through mood, through images, and through works. 

00:07:45.340   00:07:51.980
 And we have a variety of ways we understand something before we understand it in a fully articulated way. 

00:07:52.480   00:08:00.400
 So, we have this articulated space we can all discuss, and beyond that we have something that is more like the word we're embedded in. 

00:08:00.400   00:08:03.040
 It's an emotional dream we're embedded in. 

00:08:03.040   00:08:06.560
 This is based, at least in part, on our works, I will describe it later. 

00:08:06.560   00:08:09.600
 And beyond that, there is something we do not even know about. 

00:08:10.000   00:08:14.600
 And in that dream, that is where mystics live, and this is where the artists live. 

00:08:14.600   00:08:19.580
 And they are intermediaries between the absolute unknown and what we know for sure. 

00:08:22.100   00:08:30.480
 See what this means in a sense, what we know is based on knowledge we do not really understand. 

00:08:30.480   00:08:36.700
 And if these two things are not synchronized, you can say that our articulated knowledge is not aligned with our dream, 

00:08:36.740   00:08:40.080
 then we become separated within ourselves. 

00:08:40.080   00:08:44.320
 We think things we do not act and do things we do not dream. 

00:08:44.320   00:08:47.640
 And it creates some kind of illness of spirit. 

00:08:47.780   00:08:57.800
 And that illness of spirit, its medicine is something like an integrated belief system and representation. 

00:08:58.140   00:09:04.200
 And then people turn to things like ideologies, which I consider to be parasites on a fundamental religious substructure 

00:09:04.200   00:09:07.700
 to try to organize their thinking, and then it is a disaster. 

00:09:07.700   00:09:10.020
 And that's what Nietzsche predicted. 

00:09:10.040   00:09:19.420
 You see, he knew that by shaking the foundations of Western civilization by destroying this view, this "ideal of God," say, 

00:09:19.800   00:09:26.480
 to destabilize and move violently back and forth between nihilism (nothing is worth it) and the extremes of some ideology. 

00:09:26.480   00:09:30.160
 He was particularly concerned about the radical leftist ideology. 

00:09:30.640   00:09:38.020
 Believe it and predicted it in the late 1800s, which is truly the absolute intellectual power of astonishing magnitude. 

00:09:38.200   00:09:44.560
 He predicted that in the twentieth century hundreds of millions of people would die due to the replacement of these 

00:09:44.740   00:09:52.580
 grounded dream structures with this rational but deeply inaccurate representation of the world. 

00:09:52.580   00:09:57.920
 And we oscillated between left and right, in some sense, since then, 

00:09:57.920   00:10:01.460
 with the trunk of nihilism and despair. 

00:10:01.800   00:10:09.040
 In a sense it is the state of the modern Western man and more and more, people in general. 

00:10:09.560   00:10:18.300
 You know, I think that part of the reason why Islam is being fought by the West to such an extent, I think there are many reasons, and not all of them valid, that is for sure, 

00:10:18.500   00:10:32.740
 But one of the reasons is that, as they are still grounded in the dream, I can see that the research mind without the depths of the West represents a huge threat to the integrity of their culture. 

00:10:32.740   00:10:39.580
 And that is true, I mean, Westerners, we, all the time, undermine ourselves with our intellect seeking. 

00:10:39.600   00:10:42.160
 And I'm sorry about that. 

00:10:43.340   00:10:46.200
 There is nothing easy to do. 

00:10:46.940   00:10:52.140
 But that is still a kind of fruitful disaster. 

00:10:52.600   00:10:56.100
 And it has a real impact on the lives of people. 

00:10:56.120   00:10:58.120
 It's not an abstract thing. 

00:10:58.800   00:11:05.200
 Many times, when I treat people with depression or anxiety, for example, they have existential questions, you know? 

00:11:05.200   00:11:07.200
 It's not just a psychiatric condition. 

00:11:07.200   00:11:14.900
 Not that they simply stopped being normal because their brain chemistry disrupted, though sometimes it happens. 

00:11:14.920   00:11:23.380
 They are in fact overwhelmed by the suffering and complexity of their lives and are not sure why it is reasonable to continue life. 

00:11:23.480   00:11:31.500
 They can feel terrible negative meanings of life but are skeptical over the measure of any of the positive meanings. 

00:11:31.500   00:11:36.640
 I had a client who was a very brilliant artist and until he thought it was okay. 

00:11:36.640   00:11:40.460
 Because he would go and create, and he was very good at being an artist. 

00:11:40.460   00:11:47.040
 He had that personality that was constantly creative and pretty bright, though self-indulgent. 

00:11:47.100   00:11:59.400
 But as soon as he began to think about what he was doing, he would start to twist the branch he was sitting on. 

00:11:59.400   00:12:05.600
 He would start to criticize what he is doing, even the utility of it, though it was obviously useful. 

00:12:05.600   00:12:10.220
 And then it would be very, very hard to even motivate him to create. 

00:12:10.660   00:12:23.260
 He always reminded me of a good example of the consequences of your rational intellect being in some respects from your being. 

00:12:23.260   00:12:26.800
 Slow enough to actually question the usefulness of your being. 

00:12:27.140   00:12:30.740
 And that's not a good thing, not a good thing. 

00:12:31.960   00:12:39.560
 This is not really a good thing because it manifests itself not only in a particular psychopathology but also in social psychopathology, 

00:12:39.580   00:12:49.480
 And this is the tendency of people to get involved in ideology, which I really mean, they are like screaming religions, that's the right way to think about them. 

00:12:49.480   00:12:53.300
 They are like a religion lacking arm and leg but can still jump. 

00:12:53.300   00:12:59.760
 And it provides a certain amount of security and group identity, but is distorted and faded, dense and bent. 

00:12:59.780   00:13:03.620
 And it is a parasite on something that is fundamental, which is rich and true. 

00:13:04.060   00:13:06.380
 So at least it looks like me. 

00:13:06.560   00:13:11.660
 So I think it is very important to solve this problem. 

00:13:12.140   00:13:17.220
 I think there is nothing more important than it could be. 

00:13:17.220   00:13:20.500
 I thought it for a long, long time. 

00:13:20.900   00:13:23.300
 Probably from the early eighties, 

00:13:24.520   00:13:31.520
 when I began to look at the role that belief systems play in regulating psychological and social health. 

00:13:32.240   00:13:38.880
 We can say that they do this because people are excited about challenging their belief systems. 

00:13:38.880   00:13:40.960
 It's like, why the hell actually cares? 

00:13:40.960   00:13:47.580
 What's the Difference If All Your Ideological Facts Are 100% Accurate? 

00:13:47.580   00:13:52.420
 People are incredibly upset when you go into the facts, so to say. 

00:13:52.420   00:13:52.920
 [LAUGHTER] 

00:13:53.000   00:13:57.940
 And it is not at all obvious why. 

00:13:58.060   00:14:03.580
 But there is a fundamental truth in it. 

00:14:03.580   00:14:07.640
 It's like they're on a raft in the middle of the ocean and you're starting to pull off the logs. 

00:14:07.640   00:14:10.040
 He fears he will fall and drown. 

00:14:10.120   00:14:11.960
 It's like drowning in what? 

00:14:11.960   00:14:15.460
 What are the logs that protect them? 

00:14:15.600   00:14:20.980
 Why are they so afraid to move beyond the boundaries of the ideological system? 

00:14:21.220   00:14:23.220
 These are not obvious things. 

00:14:23.680   00:14:27.760
 So I've been trying to figure it out for a long time. 

00:14:27.760   00:14:31.400
 I was doing some lectures about it on YouTube; most of you know it. 

00:14:31.400   00:14:36.960
 Some of the things I'm going to talk about in this series have already heard if you've been listening to YouTube videos. 

00:14:36.960   00:14:40.360
 You know, I'm trying to shoot from different angles. 

00:14:40.800   00:14:47.840
 So Nietzsche's idea was that human beings would have to create their own values ​​in essence. 

00:14:47.840   00:14:51.760
 Now he realized that people understood that we have bodies and that we have motivations and emotions. 

00:14:51.800   00:15:02.880
 He was a romantic thinker, in a sense, but much ahead of his time, because he knew that our ability to think was not a free floating soul, but was built into our physiology, 

00:15:02.880   00:15:06.860
 limited by our emotions, shaped by our motivations, shaped by our body. 

00:15:06.900   00:15:07.800
 She understood that. 

00:15:08.000   00:15:18.340
 But he still believed that the only possible way of solving problems for human beings is to become something like God and to create their own values. 

00:15:18.580   00:15:25.380
 And he was thinking about a person who creates his values ​​as a super-man or a superman. 

00:15:25.720   00:15:35.500
 And it was one of the parts of the Nietzsche philosophy that the Nazis had to extract from the context and use their ideology of over-human fuel. 

00:15:38.040   00:15:39.700
 And we know what happened to that. 

00:15:39.700   00:15:41.780
 It does not seem right, that's for sure. 

00:15:44.000   00:15:46.880
 I also spent a lot of time reading Carl Junga. 

00:15:46.940   00:15:55.180
 Right through Jung and Jean Piaget, who was a development psychologist, I began to realize that our articulated thinking systems 

00:15:55.860   00:16:02.520
 embedded in something like sleep, and that dream was, in a complex way, informed of the way we acted. 

00:16:05.540   00:16:08.160
 We are doing things we do not understand all the time. 

00:16:08.160   00:16:12.980
 If that were not the case, we would not need psychology, sociology or anthropology or anything else 

00:16:13.000   00:16:15.360
 because we would be completely transparent to ourselves. 

00:16:15.500   00:16:16.720
 And obviously we did not. 

00:16:17.020   00:16:25.160
 So, we are much more complicated than we understand, which means that the way we behave contains more information than we know. 

00:16:25.580   00:16:33.840
 And the part of the dream that surrounds our articulated knowledge is extracted as a result of observing each other how we behave 

00:16:33.840   00:16:37.680
 and we talked about it for thousands and thousands of years. 

00:16:37.800   00:16:42.520
 Pulling out patterns of behavior that characterize mankind. 

00:16:42.740   00:16:50.060
 And trying to show them, partly by imitation, but also by drama and mythology, literature and art, and all that. 

00:16:50.060   00:16:53.080
 Show what we are so we can understand what we are. 

00:16:53.600   00:16:59.660
 This process of understanding is what I see, at least in part, in biblical stories. 

00:16:59.740   00:17:07.300
 And the stories are incomplete and uncomfortable and contradictory and all that is one of the things that make the book so complex. 

00:17:07.380   00:17:17.700
 But I see the struggle of mankind to rise above their animal ancestors, and to become aware of what it means to be a man. 

00:17:18.000   00:17:23.760
 And that is a very difficult thing because we do not know who we are or what we are or where we came from or of any of these things. 

00:17:24.100   00:17:28.560
 Life is an unbroken chain of three and a half billion years. 

00:17:28.560   00:17:30.200
 That's absolutely incredible. 

00:17:30.260   00:17:35.780
 Each of your ancestors has successfully reproduced three and a half billion years. 

00:17:36.000   00:17:37.920
 Absolutely incredible. 

00:17:38.140   00:17:43.600
 We got out of the ground and dust and here we are, aware, but not knowing. 

00:17:44.100   00:17:45.760
 And we're trying to figure out who we are. 

00:17:46.100   00:17:53.100
 The story, or a few stories we've talked about three thousand years ago, seems to have something to offer. 

00:17:53.380   00:18:00.280
 So when I look at the stories in the Bible, I do, I would say, in some sense, with a beginner's mind. 

00:18:00.320   00:18:02.080
 It's a secret, this book. 

00:18:02.220   00:18:11.180
 How the devil was made, why it was created, why we saved it, how it happened to motivate the entire culture for more than two thousand years and transform the world. 

00:18:11.500   00:18:13.420
 What is happening? How did this happen? 

00:18:13.800   00:18:21.860
 It is not obvious, and one of the things that bother me because of the ridiculous critics of religion is that they do not take this thing seriously. 

00:18:21.860   00:18:23.320
 And that is a serious phenomenon. 

00:18:24.700   00:18:29.240
 Not only because people have the capacity for religious experience and no one knows why it is so. 

00:18:29.240   00:18:32.420
 I mean, you can reliably stimulate it, in different ways. 

00:18:32.420   00:18:34.520
 You can do this by stimulating the brain. 

00:18:34.520   00:18:36.160
 Surely you can do it with drugs. 

00:18:36.160   00:18:43.120
 There is, in particular, a psychedelic variety, which regularly generates divine revelation. 

00:18:43.120   00:18:49.160
 People use such drugs, God only knows how long, fifty thousand years, maybe more than that, 

00:18:49.400   00:18:53.080
 to create a kind of intimate union with the divine. 

00:18:53.080   00:18:57.420
 We do not understand anything about this either when we discovered psychedelics in the late sixties. 

00:18:57.420   00:19:03.860
 It is shocking to all that they were simultaneously made illegally and abandoned, for research purposes, for fifty years. 

00:19:03.860   00:19:07.380
 And no wonder, who was the one who expected the devil? 

00:19:07.840   00:19:08.400
 Nobody. 

00:19:10.320   00:19:10.820
 Now, 

00:19:12.640   00:19:19.640
 Jung was a student of Nietzsche, and also, I would say, a very sharp critic of Nietzsche. 

00:19:19.800   00:19:22.700
 Freud taught him 

00:19:24.060   00:19:32.360
 Freud, I suppose, in some sense, began collecting the information we had about the idea that people were living in a dream. 

00:19:32.360   00:19:36.720
 You know, Freud was the one who popularized the idea of ​​an unconscious mind. 

00:19:36.720   00:19:42.860
 Today, we take it for granted, so much so that we do not understand how this was actually a revolutionary idea. 

00:19:42.860   00:19:50.020
 But what happened to Freud is that we have pulled all the core out of the bone, so to say, and left the spike. 

00:19:50.020   00:19:55.620
 And now, when we think of Freud, we just think about the tails, for that's all that was rejected. 

00:19:55.620   00:20:05.600
 But so much that it has revealed part of our popular concept now, including the idea that your perception, your actions and your thoughts are all that you would say, 

00:20:05.600   00:20:11.720
 informed and shaped by unconscious motivations that are not part of your voluntary control. 

00:20:11.720   00:20:13.500
 And that is a very, very strange thing. 

00:20:13.500   00:20:18.160
 This is one of the most disturbing things about psychoanalytic theories 

00:20:18.160   00:20:27.300
 psychoanalytic theories are something like: you are a luxurious collection of living sub-personalities, each with its own set of motivations and perceptions 

00:20:27.300   00:20:29.860
 and emotions and rationality, all this. 

00:20:30.260   00:20:38.840
 And you have limited control over the team, so you are like a multitude of inner personalities loosely linked to unity. 

00:20:39.120   00:20:47.520
 And you know that because you can not control it well; which is one of Jung's objections to Nietzsche's idea that we can create our own values 

00:20:47.520   00:20:51.400
 Jung did not believe it, especially after interacting with Freud. 

00:20:51.400   00:20:58.600
 Because he saw human beings deeply, deeply influenced by things beyond their conscious control. 

00:20:58.920   00:21:01.600
 Nobody really knows how to understand these things. 

00:21:01.840   00:21:06.380
 Cognitive psychologists in some sense think of these things as computer machines. 

00:21:06.800   00:21:10.740
 The ancient people, I think, thought of them as gods, though it is more complicated than that. 

00:21:10.740   00:21:16.880
 Like rage was a god. Mars, God of anger, that's what you possess when you're angry. 

00:21:16.880   00:21:21.120
 She has a point, she says what she wants to say. 

00:21:21.120   00:21:24.640
 And that can have very little to do with what you want to say when you're aware. 

00:21:24.980   00:21:27.560
 And not just living in it, but in everyone else. 

00:21:27.560   00:21:30.940
 And lives forever, and even lives in animals. 

00:21:31.060   00:21:40.740
 So, it is a transcendental psychological entity that inhabits the body's politics, as thoughts inhabit the brain. 

00:21:40.740   00:21:42.280
 This is one way of thinking about it. 

00:21:42.540   00:21:46.780
 It is a very strange way of thinking, but certainly has its place. 

00:21:47.260   00:21:51.820
 And they are in some sense of the deity, though it's not that easy. 

00:21:52.440   00:21:59.820
 And so Jung was very interested in the dreams and began to understand the relationship between dreams and myths. 

00:21:59.880   00:22:06.740
 Because she would see the stories she knew in her clients because she was deeply talked about mythology. 

00:22:06.760   00:22:17.780
 And then he began to believe that the dream was a birthplace of myths and that there was a constant interaction between these two processes, dreams and storytelling. 

00:22:17.780   00:22:21.580
 Well, you know, you usually recount your dreams as stories you remember them. 

00:22:21.740   00:22:25.000
 Some people dream dreams all the time, like two or three nights in the sequel. 

00:22:25.000   00:22:26.540
 I have such clients. 

00:22:26.540   00:22:30.280
 They often have archetypal dreams that have a very clear mythological structure. 

00:22:30.280   00:22:36.280
 I think this is the case with people who are creative, by the way, especially if they were unstable at the time. 

00:22:36.340   00:22:46.160
 Because the dream tends to occupy the space of uncertainty and focus on illuminating an unknown reality before you even come into contact with it. 

00:22:46.160   00:22:50.620
 So, as if the dream is the birthplace of thinking, it's a good way of thinking about it. 

00:22:50.620   00:22:54.020
 Because this is the birthplace of thinking, it is not so clear. 

00:22:54.020   00:22:58.340
 He does his best to shape something. It was Jung's notion, 

00:22:59.040   00:23:04.480
 unlike Freud, who believed there were sensors, internal sensors that hid the real message of dream. 

00:23:04.520   00:23:15.440
 That was not what Jung believed, believing that the dream was trying to express reality that was still beyond the fully articulated conscious understanding. 

00:23:15.440   00:23:22.080
 You see, thoughts appear in your head, right? That's obvious. Bang, you never ask, it just appears. 

00:23:22.080   00:23:23.640
 But what the hell does that mean? 

00:23:24.100   00:23:25.920
 Thought appears in your mind. 

00:23:25.920   00:23:28.660
 What is this funny explanation? 

00:23:30.660   00:23:32.400
 It does not help anything. 

00:23:32.400   00:23:33.900
 Where does it come from? 

00:23:34.020   00:23:36.820
 Well, ever since. It just seems to me in my head. 

00:23:36.820   00:23:41.140
 Okay, that's not a very sophisticated explanation, as it turned out. 

00:23:41.400   00:23:45.760
 Then think about it; those thoughts you think, so where do they come from? 

00:23:45.760   00:23:47.800
 Well, it's often other people's thoughts, do not they? 

00:23:47.820   00:23:55.440
 Someone's dead for a long time, that might be a part of it, just like the words you're thinking of people who are long dead. 

00:23:55.440   00:24:00.420
 And so you are informed by the spirit of your ancestors, this is one of the ways to look at it. 

00:24:00.420   00:24:05.080
 And your motivations tell you, your emotions speak to you, your body tells you. 

00:24:05.080   00:24:08.780
 And all this, at least partially, through dreams. 

00:24:09.320   00:24:13.480
 And the dream is the birthplace of a fully articulated idea. 

00:24:14.160   00:24:16.820
 They do not come from nothing completely, do they? 

00:24:16.900   00:24:25.520
 They have a developmental origins, and God knows only how long it originated, even to say something like "I'm aware of it." 

00:24:27.440   00:24:29.580
 Chimpanzees do not say that. 

00:24:30.260   00:24:36.120
 Seven million years have passed since we separated from the chimpanzee, from the common ancestor. 

00:24:36.180   00:24:43.320
 They do not have articulated knowledge and very little self-education in some sense and very little self-awareness. 

00:24:43.660   00:24:45.320
 And that's not the case at all. 

00:24:45.640   00:24:51.440
 We had to understand all this, you know, during a seven million year trip. 

00:24:51.920   00:24:59.340
 And I think something is depicted and captured, in some sense, in these ancient stories. 

00:24:59.400   00:25:08.400
 For which I believe that part, and especially the oldest stories in Genesis, which stories we will start with, were ... it ... 

00:25:08.820   00:25:16.660
 some of the archaic nature of human beings are embedded in these stories, and it is very, very instructive, as far as I can tell. 

00:25:16.660   00:25:18.280
 I'll just give one quick example. 

00:25:18.280   00:25:22.820
 You know there is an idea of ​​sacrifice in the Old Testament. 

00:25:23.160   00:25:30.460
 And that's pretty barbaric, you know, I mean the story of Abraham and Isaac, that's a good example because Abraham was called to sacrifice his own son, 

00:25:30.460   00:25:34.420
 which does not actually look like something that the reasonable God would ask you to do, right? 

00:25:34.800   00:25:40.880
 God in the Old Testament is often cruel and arbitrary and demanding and paradoxical, 

00:25:40.960   00:25:51.840
 which is one of the things that really gives life to the book because it has not arranged a committee, you know, a board that was worried not to offend someone, that's for sure. 

00:25:51.840   00:25:52.880
 [LAUGHTER] 

00:25:54.000   00:26:02.080
 [APPLAUSE] 

00:26:04.580   00:26:14.580
 So Jung believed the dream was the birthplace of thought and I expanded that idea because one of the things I was deeply asked was, 

00:26:14.580   00:26:17.780
 you know, you have a dream and then someone interprets it. 

00:26:18.100   00:26:25.940
 It can be argued whether the interpretation is valid, just as you can discuss whether the interpretation of a novel or a movie is valid, right? 

00:26:26.360   00:26:30.100
 It is very difficult to determine with any degree of accuracy, 

00:26:30.340   00:26:32.420
 which partly belongs to postmodern criticism. 

00:26:32.860   00:26:43.420
 But my observations are that people will present a dream, and sometimes we can extract from it useful information that this person has not noticed 

00:26:44.060   00:26:46.140
 And then they get a flash of insight. 

00:26:46.140   00:26:52.620
 For me it is a sign that we have come across something that unites a part of that person who had not been united before. 

00:26:52.680   00:27:01.220
 Things are bothering, which is often what a good story to do, and sometimes good theories, you know, if things get bogged down, there's a little light, 

00:27:01.220   00:27:05.940
 and this is one of the features I used for precision in dreams. 

00:27:06.680   00:27:13.900
 In my family, just after I married, I knew how to argue with my wife, arguing about this and those 

00:27:15.640   00:27:26.880
 I'm a pretty hot head and so I'm all upset and upset about what we've been discussing and she would go to sleep, which would really make me happy, that's so embarrassing! 

00:27:26.980   00:27:28.260
 [LAUGHTER] 

00:27:28.620   00:27:35.620
 Because I could not sleep, did not I? I would grin my nails, and she would sleep alongside me, and it was so excruciating. 

00:27:35.980   00:27:43.260
 But you would often have a dream, you know, and next morning you would have discussed with me, and then we could reveal what was hidden behind our quarrel. 

00:27:43.580   00:27:47.160
 It was incredibly useful, though it made it extremely difficult. 

00:27:49.140   00:27:50.580
 You know, Jung convinced me. 

00:27:50.680   00:28:00.420
 It seemed to me that his ideas about the relationship between dreams and mythology, drama and literature were meaningful, and the relationship between that and art. 

00:28:00.640   00:28:04.140
 I know an Indian carpenter, he is from the Kwakwaka'wakw tribe. 

00:28:04.420   00:28:10.180
 He drew a bunch of wooden sculptures, totems and masks I have in my house. 

00:28:10.180   00:28:12.040
 It's a very interesting person. 

00:28:12.040   00:28:18.080
 Not particularly literate, and it is still full of this ancient, 13,000-year-old tradition. 

00:28:18.080   00:28:26.420
 He speaks the original language, and the fact that he is not literally left him in the mind of someone who is not good with the words. 

00:28:26.420   00:28:32.100
 Such people are not stupid, they are just not eloquent, so their brains are differently organized in many ways. 

00:28:32.100   00:28:42.280
 And I asked him about his intuition for his razor, and he told me that dreams, haide masks, you know what they look like, (Indian masks with the faces of various creatures) 

00:28:42.340   00:28:47.520
 His people are mostly related to Haid, and this is the same kind of style. 

00:28:47.960   00:28:53.320
 And he said he was dreaming of such a face and could remember the military dreams. 

00:28:53.380   00:29:01.840
 He also talks with his grandfather, who taught him how to cut, into his dreams often. If there is a problem with the carvings, grandparents will come and talk to them. 

00:29:02.280   00:29:09.420
 But he sees creatures that will cut life, in an animated sense, in his imagination. 

00:29:09.420   00:29:15.080
 I mean, it's not difficult. First of all, I have no reason to believe him. He is a very, very direct person. 

00:29:15.080   00:29:20.860
 And there is no motivation to do that, I would, in a sense, invent such a story. 

00:29:20.860   00:29:23.060
 There is no reason why he could do it. 

00:29:23.060   00:29:26.820
 I do not think he told a lot of people about it. Think it's a little crazy, you know? 

00:29:26.820   00:29:31.700
 He said when he was a child, he thought he was crazy, because he was dreaming it all the time. 

00:29:32.080   00:29:34.360
 About these creatures and so on. 

00:29:34.360   00:29:36.440
 And so it was not something he talked to everyone. 

00:29:36.960   00:29:43.920
 But I made it fascinating because I see in it a part of the manifestation of this uninterrupted tradition. 

00:29:43.920   00:29:48.600
 We have no idea how such traditions really carry thousands and thousands of years, is not it? 

00:29:48.960   00:29:55.620
 Part is transmitted orally and remembered, part of the action and dramatization, and then part of it will be imagination. 

00:29:55.620   00:29:59.180
 And people who are not written, store information in a completely different way than we do. 

00:29:59.180   00:30:02.060
 We do not remember anything. Everything is written in the books, right? 

00:30:02.060   00:30:07.540
 But if you are from oral culture, especially if you are so trained, you have all this information. 

00:30:07.540   00:30:11.900
 You can talk and tell stories, and you really know them. 

00:30:11.900   00:30:14.500
 You know, modern people no longer know how it is. 

00:30:14.500   00:30:20.640
 I suspect that there may be more than two of you in the audience who might say something out of memory, like a song about thirty verses. 

00:30:20.640   00:30:23.560
 You know, and poetry is written so that people can do it. 

00:30:23.560   00:30:29.040
 That is why there is such a form so people can remember and deal with it. 

00:30:29.060   00:30:30.680
 But we never do it again. 

00:30:31.600   00:30:33.120
 Basically, back to Jung. 

00:30:35.300   00:30:40.480
 Jung was a big believer in dreams and knew that dreams would talk about things you did not know. 

00:30:40.480   00:30:47.780
 And then I thought, how can that be? How do you think something you think in your head can say something you do not know? 

00:30:47.840   00:30:49.760
 How does that make sense? 

00:30:49.940   00:30:55.140
 First of all, why do not we understand that? Why does it have to emerge in the form of a dream? 

00:30:55.140   00:30:59.880
 It's like you're not ... something happens to you that you do not control, right? 

00:30:59.880   00:31:02.780
 The dream is happening just as your life is happening. 

00:31:02.780   00:31:09.300
 I mean, there are odd lucid dreamers who can, you know, apply a certain amount of conscious control, but most of the time it's 

00:31:09.560   00:31:16.480
 Sleep and sleep and this crazy, complicated world is manifested within you. 

00:31:16.700   00:31:19.760
 And you do not know how. You can not do it when you are awake. 

00:31:20.080   00:31:23.260
 And you do not know what that means! Think: What the hell's going on? 

00:31:23.260   00:31:26.920
 And that is one of the things that is so scary with psychoanalysts because 

00:31:27.300   00:31:37.100
 You have this with Freud and Jung, and you really start to realize that there are things that happen within you that control you, and not vice versa. 

00:31:37.100   00:31:46.860
 You, you know, use little control, but there are ghost manifestations, so to say within you that determine the way you go through life. 

00:31:47.360   00:31:50.000
 And you do not control it. And what controls it? 

00:31:50.880   00:31:59.860
 Is it by chance? You know, there are people who have claimed that dreams are just the result of random neural hits, which is the theory I think is absurd. 

00:31:59.860   00:32:02.380
 Because there is nothing random in dreams. 

00:32:02.740   00:32:06.620
 They are very, very structured and very, very complex. 

00:32:06.620   00:32:13.040
 Not as a static snow on a television screen or on a radio. These things are complicated. 

00:32:13.520   00:32:18.980
 Also, I've often seen people have very coherent dreams that have a perfect narrative structure. 

00:32:19.340   00:32:26.740
 They are fully developed, in some sense. And so that theory simply does not hold water. I just do not see it useful at all. 

00:32:28.900   00:32:34.480
 So it is more likely to seriously understand this phenomenon and say that there is something in dreams. 

00:32:34.480   00:32:39.340
 Well, dream the future and try to turn it into reality. It seems to be important. 

00:32:39.840   00:32:47.740
 Or maybe you have a nightmare and try to do it in reality because people do it, for example, if they are full of hate and bitterness. 

00:32:48.100   00:32:53.720
 And it manifests itself in terrible fantasies, and people go and act upon them. 

00:32:54.240   00:33:00.260
 These things are powerful, you know, and the whole nation can remain caught in a collective dream. That happened to the Nazis. 

00:33:00.260   00:33:03.060
 This happened to Nazi Germany in the 1930s. 

00:33:03.060   00:33:07.920
 It was an absolutely incredible, terrible destructive spectacle. 

00:33:07.920   00:33:14.280
 And the same thing happened with the Soviet Union, the same thing in China. You should start to take these things seriously. 

00:33:14.660   00:33:16.580
 You should try to figure out what's going on. 

00:33:18.280   00:33:24.280
 So, Jung believed the dream had more information than it was already articulated. 

00:33:25.080   00:33:27.480
 The artists do the same thing. you know. 

00:33:28.360   00:33:32.460
 People go to museums and watch the pictures, renaissance or modern. 

00:33:32.460   00:33:34.600
 And they do not really know why they are there. 

00:33:34.840   00:33:42.280
 I was in a museum in New York, I do not remember what, but it was full of Renaissance art. 

00:33:42.280   00:33:50.540
 Great painters, the greatest painters, and I thought that the room was worth over a billion dollars, or something like that, because it's about 20 pictures. 

00:33:50.780   00:33:51.480
 Priceless. 

00:33:51.820   00:33:58.280
 The first thing, why do you paint so much, and why the museum in the world's largest city is devoted to them, 

00:33:58.280   00:34:02.980
 And why do people come from all over the world to see them? What do these people actually do? 

00:34:03.140   00:34:12.080
 one of them was the Assumption of Mary, a beautifully painted, absolutely radiant piece of art, and about 20 people standing in front of the picture, looking at her. 

00:34:12.080   00:34:13.840
 Think what these people want? 

00:34:14.320   00:34:18.800
 They do not know why they went to New York to come and see these pictures? 

00:34:18.800   00:34:21.420
 Not that they know! Why is it so much worth? 

00:34:21.420   00:34:27.840
 I know that there is a status quo in that, but it raises the question; Why did these items become so high on status? 

00:34:27.840   00:34:30.900
 What's so fascinating about them? 

00:34:32.140   00:34:33.780
 Well, we're weird creatures. 

00:34:35.160   00:34:40.000
 So I tried to figure out part; Where does the information come from in the dream? 

00:34:40.440   00:34:43.920
 Because it has to come from somewhere, and you can think of it as a revelation. 

00:34:44.640   00:34:49.460
 Because something comes out of the gaps, new knowledge. it is a revelation. 

00:34:49.460   00:34:51.720
 You did not make it, it just came out. 

00:34:52.260   00:34:59.260
 You see, one of the things I want to accomplish with this series ... I have a mind of scientists, and I'm quite a rational person. 

00:34:59.260   00:35:05.180
 And I like to have an explanation that is rational and provable before I ask for any other explanation. 

00:35:05.440   00:35:14.220
 And I do not want to say that whatever is related to the divine can be reduced to biology, evolutionary history, or anything like that. 

00:35:14.280   00:35:19.000
 But if it is possible to make that reduction, I will do it. 

00:35:19.640   00:35:30.480
 So I will leave other phenomena that are somewhere in the air because they can not be analyzed in detail or are in the category of mystical and religious experiences that we do not even understand. 

00:35:32.060   00:35:35.980
 So artists look at each other. 

00:35:36.360   00:35:38.940
 They are watching people and showing what they see. 

00:35:38.940   00:35:42.520
 And they send us a message of what they see, and teach us to see. 

00:35:42.520   00:35:46.020
 Does not necessarily mean we learn from them. 

00:35:46.540   00:35:49.940
 But we learn something, or at least we behave like that. 

00:35:50.020   00:35:57.020
 We go to the cinema to watch the movies, watch the stories, we are constantly immersing in fiction. It's all an artist product. 

00:35:57.400   00:36:03.560
 And for many people, the world of art is a living world, especially if you are a creative person. 

00:36:03.560   00:36:08.840
 Creative people, artists are those who push the knowledge of mankind forward. 

00:36:08.940   00:36:12.360
 And they do their first work of art. They're on the verge. 

00:36:12.360   00:36:19.540
 The dancers do it, poets do it, poets, visual artists, musicians do it, and we're not sure what to do 

00:36:19.540   00:36:23.180
 we're not sure what the musicians are doing. What do they do? Why do we really love music? 

00:36:23.760   00:36:27.380
 It gives you a deep hint of the meaning of things. 

00:36:27.760   00:36:32.800
 That is not questionable. You are going to the concert and are delighted, it is similar to a religious experience. 

00:36:32.840   00:36:37.440
 Especially if it really works and launches the audience, you know? 

00:36:37.440   00:36:41.340
 there is something incredibly intense about it. It makes no sense. 

00:36:41.520   00:36:44.000
 It's not easy to understand .. 

00:36:44.180   00:36:53.060
 Music has certain deep patterns in its layers, and I think that's the reality as well. 

00:36:53.080   00:37:01.900
 So I think music is a reality in some basic way, and we enter that rhythm and thus participate in existence. 

00:37:01.940   00:37:05.640
 And that's part of why this is a positive experience. 

00:37:05.640   00:37:08.640
 And we do not know what it's all about, we just go and do it. 

00:37:09.220   00:37:11.900
 It can also feed people, do not they? 

00:37:12.000   00:37:19.120
 Young people in particular, many of them live for music; from his music he draws all his meanings and shaping identity. 

00:37:19.120   00:37:23.260
 All that comes from their association with music. 

00:37:23.260   00:37:26.860
 It's part of their cultural identity. That's an interesting thing. 

00:37:29.800   00:37:33.320
 The question remains: Where do information come from in dreams? 

00:37:33.740   00:37:42.680
 I think they are coming from keeping track of the patterns of behavior that everyone expresses their actions. 

00:37:43.220   00:37:47.720
 We've been following this forever and we have some visions of these templates. 

00:37:47.760   00:37:53.860
 It's part of our cultural history, that's what is buried in stories, fiction; part of the story of good and evil. 

00:37:53.860   00:37:55.100
 Good and bad character. 

00:37:55.100   00:37:59.260
 And romance, you know? These are canonical patterns of existence for humans. 

00:37:59.260   00:38:03.920
 And deeply affect us because they represent what we will do. 

00:38:04.120   00:38:08.660
 And we bring it to the world, along with the individual information we have about ourselves and other people. 

00:38:08.860   00:38:18.900
 These are like wave patterns of behavior manifested in the crowd over time 

00:38:18.900   00:38:22.200
 Great plays are played in a multitude of people over time. 

00:38:22.200   00:38:30.360
 And the artists are watching it, and they get a hint of what they're telling us, and then we're more clear about what we're going to do. 

00:38:30.500   00:38:37.500
 A great playwright like Shakespeare, let's say, for whom we know he wrote fiction. And then let's say, fiction is not true. 

00:38:37.500   00:38:42.140
 And then stop and think. Maybe it's true as the numbers are true. 

00:38:42.520   00:38:49.680
 You know? Numbers are abstraction from the underlying reality, but nobody in a healthy mind will think that the numbers are not true. 

00:38:49.680   00:38:54.560
 You can even say that the numbers are even more real than the things they represent, do not they? 

00:38:54.560   00:38:57.280
 Because the abstraction is so crazy powerful. 

00:38:57.280   00:39:00.080
 Once you have math, you're killing. 

00:39:00.080   00:39:02.500
 You can move the world to mathematics. 

00:39:02.780   00:39:09.560
 It is not so obvious that abstraction is less real than real reality. 

00:39:09.820   00:39:15.740
 Take fiction, like Hamlet, and you may think it is not true because it is fiction. 

00:39:15.740   00:39:18.540
 But what is this explanation? 

00:39:18.740   00:39:21.300
 It may be more true than non-fiction. 

00:39:21.300   00:39:28.200
 Because it tells the story that has to be told .. What has to be told about you, about you and you 

00:39:28.200   00:39:34.320
 And he says, here is: This is something that is a key part of human experience as such. 

00:39:34.760   00:39:39.720
 Is it? so it has extracted the abstraction from some sub-layers. 

00:39:39.940   00:39:46.940
 And it affects people because they see that the thing that is presented there is part of the pattern of their existence. 

00:39:46.940   00:39:48.640
 This is a good way to think about it. 

00:39:48.640   00:39:55.600
 And then with these old stories, ancient stories, it seems to me that this process has been going on for thousands of years. 

00:39:56.240   00:39:59.240
 It's as if we were looking at ourselves and pulling some stories out of it. 

00:39:59.640   00:40:07.380
 We are carved each other, and we show it through the drama, and then we filtered the drama, and got a filtered view. 

00:40:07.420   00:40:14.520
 And then we did it again, and at the end of that long-lasting process, God knows how long - I think some of these stories 

00:40:15.600   00:40:21.160
 Some fairy tales are ten to ten years old in a relatively unchanged form. 

00:40:21.160   00:40:25.360
 And it seems to me that archeological evidence, for example, 

00:40:25.400   00:40:34.720
 suggest that the really old stories with which the Bible begins are at least as old and probably buried in prehistory that is far older than that 

00:40:34.860   00:40:38.060
 And you can think, how can you be so sure? 

00:40:38.440   00:40:45.120
 And the answer to that is that cultures, ancient cultures do not change, or not so fast .. 

00:40:45.280   00:40:48.140
 The rest are the same! That's the answer. 

00:40:48.140   00:40:53.540
 They store their information by transferring them from generation to generation, so they remain the same. 

00:40:54.060   00:41:01.640
 And so we know, from archaeological research, there are evidence of rituals that have been performed relatively unchanged for as long as 20,000 years 

00:41:01.700   00:41:09.540
 In the caves of Japan, evidence of ritual worship of bears was discovered, which was characteristic of Western Europe. 

00:41:09.540   00:41:12.180
 So these things can take a very long time. 

00:41:14.720   00:41:18.200
 We look at each other as we behave. 

00:41:18.900   00:41:22.100
 And the question arises: How long have we been watching each other? 

00:41:22.100   00:41:28.220
 And the answer to that is in some sense, since there are nerves with the nervous system. 

00:41:28.220   00:41:32.940
 That's a long time, you know? It's a hundred million years, maybe even more. 

00:41:32.940   00:41:36.040
 we looked at each other, trying to figure out what we were going to do. 

00:41:36.040   00:41:40.400
 Throughout this time, some of this knowledge is directly embedded in our body. 

00:41:40.400   00:41:43.220
 That's why we can dance with each other, do not we? 

00:41:43.220   00:41:46.260
 Because understanding is not just something 

00:41:46.260   00:41:51.080
 what we have as an abstraction, that's something to do, you know? 

00:41:51.080   00:41:54.220
 That's what kids do when they learn to play hunting or wrestling 

00:41:54.220   00:41:59.220
 They learn to integrate their body with someone else's whines in a harmonious way 

00:41:59.220   00:42:03.660
 and teaches about co-operation and competitions, and that is all that is already in their bodies 

00:42:03.660   00:42:06.700
 This abstract knowledge, they do not know they do it. 

00:42:06.700   00:42:08.140
 They just do it. 

00:42:08.140   00:42:12.120
 so that we can even use our bodies as a platform for presenting something. 

00:42:12.120   00:42:14.960
 We've been studying each other all the time, 

00:42:14.960   00:42:18.700
 abstracting what we have in mind and that is ... 

00:42:18.700   00:42:24.560
 But what is that we are doing, what should we do? This is a more fundamental issue. 

00:42:24.560   00:42:27.720
 If you are going to live in the world and want to do it properly, 

00:42:27.740   00:42:31.560
 What exactly does it mean right, and how can it behave so? 

00:42:31.560   00:42:34.940
 Well, that's the real question, is not it? That's what everyone would want to know. 

00:42:34.940   00:42:36.600
 How to live in this world? 

00:42:36.600   00:42:39.420
 Not what the world made of. That's not the same question. 

00:42:39.420   00:42:40.860
 How to live in this world? 

00:42:40.860   00:42:43.200
 The eternal question of human beings. 

00:42:43.200   00:42:46.780
 And I guess we're the only guy who ever asked that question. 

00:42:46.780   00:42:49.840
 because all other animals just go and do what they do. 

00:42:49.840   00:42:50.720
 Not me! 

00:42:50.980   00:42:52.660
 This is a question for us. 

00:42:52.660   00:42:56.760
 We need to make him aware, we have to say it. 

00:42:56.760   00:42:58.380
 God knows why. 

00:42:58.960   00:43:00.860
 But that seems to be the case. 

00:43:01.640   00:43:02.140
 And... 

00:43:04.020   00:43:08.660
 We work, and these works are shaped by the world and society 

00:43:08.660   00:43:11.560
 in something we can not understand, but we can show it. 

00:43:11.660   00:43:16.020
 We show it in our stories, we show it to our bodies 

00:43:16.420   00:43:18.740
 And that dream gets its information 

00:43:19.080   00:43:21.800
 San is part of the process that controls everything 

00:43:22.260   00:43:23.800
 and then it tries to formulate it 

00:43:23.800   00:43:28.760
 trying to get a signal from the noise and visualize it in a dramatic form. 

00:43:28.760   00:43:30.400
 Because dream is a little drama. 

00:43:30.400   00:43:34.440
 And then you get the chance to talk about what this dream is. 

00:43:35.340   00:43:36.140
 And then you have ... 

00:43:36.140   00:43:39.120
 You have something articulate then. 

00:43:39.760   00:43:42.320
 I would say that the Bible ... 

00:43:42.680   00:43:48.340
 It is something like .. there is in this space that is half sleep, and half articulated knowledge. 

00:43:48.340   00:43:49.740
 Something like that. 

00:43:49.980   00:43:53.180
 Entering into the depths of what these stories are about, 

00:43:53.960   00:43:54.520
 Then.. 

00:43:56.560   00:43:59.080
 We can help our own self-understanding. 

00:43:59.080   00:44:00.700
 The other problem is that 

00:44:00.740   00:44:04.840
 if Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky or Jung were right 

00:44:04.840   00:44:06.340
 Dostoyevsky also, 

00:44:08.200   00:44:13.300
 that we are without the chief stone that understanding provides, lost! 

00:44:13.860   00:44:16.840
 And that is not good, because we are subject to it 

00:44:17.000   00:44:20.480
 psychological pathology. It is psychophysical pathology. 

00:44:21.160   00:44:27.200
 You know, people who are devoted to anti-religious thinkers 

00:44:27.320   00:44:32.000
 seem to believe that if we leave that dream under all these layers, 

00:44:32.040   00:44:36.340
 to automatically become rational like Descartes or Bacon, you know? 

00:44:36.340   00:44:41.480
 Intelligent, rational, scientific people of pure thinking, which I do not believe in the moment. 

00:44:41.540   00:44:43.400
 Because I do not believe there is any evidence for that. 

00:44:43.400   00:44:50.780
 I think they would become so irrational so fast that the strangest secrets of Catholicism would look positive 

00:44:51.060   00:44:54.100
 rational for contrast and I think that's already happening. 

00:44:54.920   00:44:55.420
 Therefore. 

00:44:55.600   00:45:01.960
 [APPLAUSE] 

00:45:03.220   00:45:03.720
 Alright. 

00:45:06.320   00:45:08.800
 So this is the idea in essence, you know, yes 

00:45:09.400   00:45:13.280
 There is an unknown world. That's just what we do not even know. 

00:45:13.280   00:45:17.420
 This is what is outside, the ocean that surrounds the island you are in. 

00:45:17.420   00:45:19.700
 Something like that, that chaos is incarnated. 

00:45:20.120   00:45:20.680
 And then 

00:45:20.680   00:45:24.420
 You are acting in the world and acting in ways you do not understand. 

00:45:24.420   00:45:27.220
 There is more in your works than you can understand. 

00:45:27.220   00:45:30.160
 One of the things Jung said, and I liked it when I first realized it 

00:45:30.160   00:45:34.980
 He said, "They all act toward myth, but very few people know what their motto is." 

00:45:35.060   00:45:38.220
 And you should know what your mind is, because it could be a tragedy. 

00:45:38.520   00:45:40.480
 And maybe you do not want it to be that way. 

00:45:40.600   00:45:42.580
 And that's really worth thinking because 

00:45:42.580   00:45:44.060
 Because... 

00:45:44.060   00:45:47.100
 You have patterns of behavior that characterize you, you know? 

00:45:47.100   00:45:48.920
 And only God knows where you got them. 

00:45:49.320   00:45:52.020
 Part of it is biologically, by your parents. 

00:45:52.280   00:45:53.500
 These are your unconscious assumptions. 

00:45:53.540   00:45:56.280
 This is the way that the philosophy of society has shaped you. 

00:45:56.280   00:45:59.980
 And it directs you somewhere. 

00:46:00.360   00:46:02.860
 Does he direct you where you want to go? 

00:46:02.940   00:46:06.340
 That's a good question, it's a part of self-revelation, you know? 

00:46:06.860   00:46:09.160
 We know we can not understand their deeds. 

00:46:09.600   00:46:12.640
 Almost every fight you have with someone is related to it. 

00:46:12.640   00:46:14.480
 Something like "Why did you do it?" 

00:46:14.600   00:46:17.100
 And you figure out some halfway explanation of why you did it. 

00:46:17.100   00:46:19.520
 You knock in the dark, you know? 

00:46:19.520   00:46:24.680
 You're trying to attribute it to yourself, but you can only partially. Very, very difficult 

00:46:25.280   00:46:31.840
 you are a complicated animal with the beginnings of an articulated mind, something like that. 

00:46:31.860   00:46:35.260
 And a lot more you can do. 

00:46:37.660   00:46:39.720
 Okay, so you work, right? 

00:46:39.860   00:46:40.780
 You are doing things that are in you out there. 

00:46:41.640   00:46:43.180
 And that's a kind of ability. 

00:46:43.180   00:46:45.520
 And then imagine what you are doing. 

00:46:45.520   00:46:47.800
 And imagine what everyone else is doing, and so 

00:46:47.800   00:46:51.180
 there is a tremendous amount of information in your works. 

00:46:51.400   00:46:54.600
 And then. that information was translated into a dream 

00:46:54.600   00:46:56.560
 and in art, mythology and literature. 

00:46:56.600   00:46:59.760
 And there's a terrible amount of information. 

00:47:00.060   00:47:04.120
 And something has been translated into articulated thought. 

00:47:04.120   00:47:06.380
 Let me give you one quick example of something like this. 

00:47:06.380   00:47:10.720
 I think that part of that happens in the Exodus Book, when Moses brought laws. 

00:47:10.900   00:47:13.700
 You know, he wandered with the Israelites in the wilderness forever eternity. 

00:47:13.760   00:47:18.280
 They go both left and right, worship idols, and live very hard 

00:47:18.920   00:47:21.180
 They became rebellious. 

00:47:21.560   00:47:24.740
 Moses went to the mountain and experienced a false revelation 

00:47:24.740   00:47:26.440
 in one way God sees it 

00:47:26.440   00:47:29.240
 And it enlightened him to come down with the Law. 

00:47:29.500   00:47:30.100
 You may think, well, 

00:47:30.260   00:47:33.800
 Moses acted as a judge, I know this is a mythological story. 

00:47:33.880   00:47:36.200
 Moses acts as a judge in the desert. 

00:47:36.200   00:47:39.560
 He has constantly mediated between people who have problems. 

00:47:39.560   00:47:41.640
 He was constantly trying to keep the peace. 

00:47:41.640   00:47:43.700
 What do you do if you are trying to maintain peace? 

00:47:43.700   00:47:45.820
 You are trying to understand what peace is all about. 

00:47:45.820   00:47:48.260
 Is it? You have to apply the principles. 

00:47:48.260   00:47:50.840
 So what are the principles? Well you do not really know. 

00:47:50.840   00:47:54.540
 The principles are whatever satisfies enough people to live in peace. 

00:47:54.540   00:47:56.860
 And maybe you do it some ten thousand times and then 

00:47:56.860   00:48:00.060
 you get some sense of it "Oh! These are the principles that will bring peace" 

00:48:00.060   00:48:04.260
 And then you have one day a son of consciousness, like revelation. 

00:48:04.260   00:48:07.220
 These are the rules we are following. 

00:48:07.220   00:48:10.220
 These are the Ten Commandments of God. They are here to begin with. 

00:48:10.540   00:48:16.500
 And Moses comes and says, "You see, these are the rules we are following, but now they are systematized, are not they" 

00:48:16.620   00:48:20.580
 It is all the historical process that has been condensed into 

00:48:20.580   00:48:22.720
 in a single story, but it is obvious that this has happened 

00:48:22.720   00:48:24.980
 Because we have written the law! 

00:48:25.520   00:48:28.080
 Is it? And that went well, in good legal systems, 

00:48:28.080   00:48:30.000
 She fled from the bottom to the top. 

00:48:30.000   00:48:32.580
 English law is the exact one. 

00:48:32.580   00:48:36.380
 This is the only principle-based decision, 

00:48:36.380   00:48:40.480
 which were then articulated and made into the structure of the law. 

00:48:40.480   00:48:42.720
 The law structure is something you do. 

00:48:42.780   00:48:44.940
 That is why it is the structure of the law. 

00:48:45.300   00:48:47.940
 If you are a good citizen you act according to the structure of the law. 

00:48:48.280   00:48:50.120
 The law structure has its own principles. 

00:48:50.480   00:48:54.140
 All right, then, the question is, there are principles that direct our behavior. 

00:48:54.820   00:48:56.160
 What are the principles? 

00:48:56.460   00:49:03.720
 Well, if you want the initial answer to what the ancient Israelites considered God, 

00:49:03.720   00:49:06.140
 It's something like what they meant. 

00:49:06.360   00:49:08.580
 That is not a good enough explanation. 

00:49:09.160   00:49:14.820
 But if you think you're a chimpanzee and you have a powerful, 

00:49:15.580   00:49:19.660
 the dominant figure at the top of the hierarchy. 

00:49:19.860   00:49:22.500
 That is strength, and more than that. 

00:49:22.500   00:49:26.700
 Because it is not a pure physical force that holds a chimpanzee at the top of the hierarchy. 

00:49:26.700   00:49:28.400
 Much more complicated than that. 

00:49:28.700   00:49:34.400
 You can say that there are principles that the dominant person manifests .. 

00:49:35.240   00:49:42.240
 Then you can say that this principle is much clearer if you know the ten dominant people. 

00:49:42.320   00:49:43.040
 Powerful. 

00:49:43.200   00:49:46.660
 And you can derive what domination means. 

00:49:46.660   00:49:48.800
 From this you can derive what power means. 

00:49:48.940   00:49:52.460
 And then you can separate that concept from people. 

00:49:53.000   00:49:59.360
 And we had to do it in the past, because we can say power (in the human context) and we can imagine what this means. 

00:49:59.420   00:50:03.240
 But it is separate from any manifestation of power. 

00:50:03.240   00:50:04.900
 How the hell can we do that? 

00:50:05.240   00:50:06.840
 It's so complicated! 

00:50:07.120   00:50:08.320
 If you're a chimpanzee, 

00:50:08.880   00:50:13.040
 power is in another chimp, there is no abstraction. 

00:50:13.820   00:50:19.300
 So the question is, consider this, we are in many hierarchies, many of them, for centuries. 

00:50:19.580   00:50:22.000
 We are trying to understand the principle that leads us. 

00:50:22.200   00:50:25.660
 We are trying to extract the core of the principle that leads us. 

00:50:25.720   00:50:29.720
 And let's turn it into a pattern of existence. 

00:50:29.720   00:50:32.460
 Well, something like that is God. 

00:50:32.680   00:50:35.060
 An abstract ideal. 

00:50:35.680   00:50:43.820
 And it is set in personified form, manifested in personified form, but that's fine because we are trying to get it 

00:50:44.200   00:50:51.580
 in a sense, the core of what it means to be properly functioning, properly social, 

00:50:51.580   00:50:53.940
 and properly qualified individuals. 

00:50:53.940   00:50:55.460
 We're trying to figure out what that means. 

00:50:55.820   00:51:02.060
 You need an incarnation. You need an ideal that is abstract so you can manifest it 

00:51:02.380   00:51:04.860
 and that would help you understand what this means. 

00:51:05.220   00:51:06.720
 And that's what we're aiming for. 

00:51:07.120   00:51:09.620
 This is the first theory in some sense. 

00:51:09.920   00:51:17.920
 I will go through some of the features of this abstract ideal that we have called God, but this is the first kind of theory 

00:51:19.100   00:51:27.220
 That the philosophical or moral ideal first manifests itself as a solid pattern of behavior that is characteristic of a single individual. 

00:51:27.620   00:51:29.700
 And then a group of individuals. 

00:51:30.040   00:51:32.280
 And then it's an abstraction from that group. 

00:51:32.620   00:51:35.300
 And then you have an abstraction. That is very important. 

00:51:35.580   00:51:37.940
 Here's the application in politics for example. 

00:51:45.740   00:51:52.700
 One of the discussions between early Christianity and the late Roman Empire 

00:51:53.160   00:51:58.040
 Was it a car to be a god, right? 

00:51:58.040   00:52:00.920
 To be dedicated to being in the temple. 

00:52:01.700   00:52:09.120
 And you can see why that might happen. The car is someone at the top of a very steep hierarchical pyramid, someone with incredible power and influence. 

00:52:09.480   00:52:11.880
 But the Christian response to it was, 

00:52:12.680   00:52:19.720
 never mix a certain sovereign with the principle of sovereignty. 

00:52:20.400   00:52:21.280
 That's awesome. 

00:52:21.440   00:52:28.440
 See how difficult it was to come to the idea that even a person who has the power is subordinated to something else. 

00:52:28.720   00:52:33.520
 Subordinated to the divine principle, we call this in the absence of a better word. 

00:52:33.740   00:52:37.820
 So even the king is subordinated to that principle. 

00:52:37.820   00:52:43.900
 And we still believe that our presidents or prime ministers are subject to the law. 

00:52:44.240   00:52:50.000
 Are you law enforcement, right? There is a principle within which even the leader is subordinate. 

00:52:50.320   00:52:58.480
 Without this, you might be able to debate whether there is any civilized society at all if the ruler turns into something that is almighty and above all. 

00:52:58.480   00:53:04.060
 That's exactly what happened to the Soviet Union, and what happened to the people of China and the Nazis. 

00:53:04.060   00:53:07.960
 Because there was nothing in front of which the mighty would be subordinate. 

00:53:08.520   00:53:10.620
 They should be subordinate to God. 

00:53:10.740   00:53:11.960
 So what does that mean? 

00:53:12.120   00:53:20.160
 Well, we will break this idea, but in part it means that you are subordinate, even if you are sovereign, to the very principle of sovereignty. 

00:53:20.600   00:53:23.800
 And then the question is, what is the principle of sovereignty? 

00:53:23.800   00:53:27.860
 And I can tell you, we've been doing it for a long time. 

00:53:28.140   00:53:30.600
 And that is one of the things we will talk about. 

00:53:30.600   00:53:39.320
 Because the ancient inhabitants of Mesopotamia and Egypt had some very dramatic ideas about it. 

00:53:41.060   00:53:45.460
 Just a quick example, they described the deity known as Marduk .. 

00:53:46.020   00:53:53.300
 And Marduk was a Mesopotamian deity, and if you can imagine, it is about this; 

00:53:53.620   00:53:58.740
 The empire emerged after the Ice Age before, say 10-15 thousand years ago 

00:53:59.000   00:54:00.580
 all the tribes gathered together. 

00:54:00.580   00:54:04.340
 And each of these tribes had their own deities, their own images of ideals. 

00:54:04.340   00:54:06.940
 But then they started living on the same territory, did not they? 

00:54:07.380   00:54:13.880
 So that one tribe had a deity A, and the other tribe was a divinity B, and one tribe could have exterminated another 

00:54:13.880   00:54:16.200
 And then the deity A that he won was left. 

00:54:16.200   00:54:22.440
 But that was not so good because, maybe you would trade with that other tribe, you might not want to lose half of the population in the war 

00:54:22.540   00:54:23.320
 something so. 

00:54:23.360   00:54:28.480
 And then you should have a debate on what the deity needs to have priority. 

00:54:28.480   00:54:30.440
 What Idea Will Get Priority? 

00:54:30.440   00:54:36.900
 It seems to have happened that it would be presented in mythological representations as a fight of deities in, say, the heavenly space. 

00:54:36.900   00:54:40.540
 But from practical application, this is a dialogue that still lasts. 

00:54:40.660   00:54:42.520
 You believe this, you believe it. 

00:54:42.520   00:54:44.080
 You believe this, you believe it 

00:54:44.080   00:54:46.160
 How do we mix it together? 

00:54:46.420   00:54:52.600
 So take Divinity A and Divinity B, and maybe you will get a deity C from it. 

00:54:52.640   00:54:56.080
 And you say, so, the deity C now has the properties of deities A and B. 

00:54:56.220   00:54:57.860
 And then there are some tribes. 

00:54:58.000   00:55:00.340
 IC becomes their deity. 

00:55:00.940   00:55:04.060
 Like Marduk, for example, he has more names. 

00:55:04.400   00:55:12.800
 About fifty different names. Well, those names, at least in part, are the names of subordinate deities representing tribes that have merged to make civilization. 

00:55:13.080   00:55:16.840
 This is part of the process by which the abstract ideal becomes abstract. 

00:55:17.300   00:55:20.480
 They thought this was important, and it worked because the tribe survived. 

00:55:20.480   00:55:23.420
 This is important, and it works because the tribe survived 

00:55:23.960   00:55:27.040
 So, we will take the best of both deities if we can, 

00:55:27.040   00:55:32.340
 And draw something that is even more abstract, covering both tribes. 

00:55:32.720   00:55:37.960
 One of the more interesting things about Marduk, I will just list a couple of his features 

00:55:38.680   00:55:40.660
 She has eyes around her head. 

00:55:40.940   00:55:45.480
 He was chosen from other deities to be king deity. That's pretty interesting. 

00:55:45.480   00:55:48.820
 And they chose him because they faced a terrible threat. 

00:55:49.040   00:55:52.340
 Something similar to the flood and the monster combined .. 

00:55:52.640   00:55:58.420
 And Marduk said that if he chose him for the king of deities, he would stop the flood-monster. 

00:55:58.560   00:56:04.360
 And so prevent all of them from dying. It's a serious threat, the very chaos that is coming back. 

00:56:04.740   00:56:10.400
 And then all the deities agree and choose it. Marduk then has a new look. She has eyes all over her head. 

00:56:10.520   00:56:12.280
 And he pronounces magical words. 

00:56:12.680   00:56:17.040
 He then fights with the goddess called Tiamat. 

00:56:17.260   00:56:24.200
 You should know it, because the word Tiamat is closely related to the word "Tehom," T, E, H, O, M. (Hebrew word for depth, deep) 

00:56:24.200   00:56:29.740
 And Tehom is the chaos from which God makes the beginning of time in the Book of Genesis. 

00:56:29.740   00:56:32.340
 It is closely related to this story. 

00:56:32.380   00:56:39.780
 And Marduk with his eyes on the head and the ability to pronounce the magical words goes to clash with Tiamat, who is like a watery sea dragon 

00:56:39.780   00:56:40.780
 Something like that. 

00:56:41.700   00:56:48.740
 This is a classic story of St. Francis. Jury, who goes and kills the dragon. 

00:56:48.860   00:56:50.540
 And he cries (Tiamat) into pieces. 

00:56:50.940   00:56:54.560
 And make the world out of these bits, and that is the world in which people live. 

00:56:55.060   00:56:57.780
 The Mesopotamian car worked like Marduk. 

00:56:57.780   00:57:00.700
 He was allowed to be a car as long as he was a good Marduk. 

00:57:00.700   00:57:05.000
 And that meant he had his eyes on his head, and he could speak magical words 

00:57:05.180   00:57:06.580
 He could have spoken correctly. 

00:57:07.280   00:57:11.140
 And we begin to observe then the core of the leader, right? 

00:57:11.140   00:57:12.360
 Because what is leadership? 

00:57:12.360   00:57:17.260
 Capacity to see what's in front of your eyes and maybe in all directions. 

00:57:17.260   00:57:23.560
 The capacity to use your language properly, by transforming it, and in a way that you can make the order from chaos. 

00:57:24.000   00:57:28.160
 Only God knows how long it took the Mesopotamians to understand it. 

00:57:28.160   00:57:30.140
 The best thing they could do was play the drama. 

00:57:30.200   00:57:32.700
 But it's absolutely amazingly brilliant. 

00:57:33.120   00:57:38.620
 You know? This is by no means obvious, and chaos, chaos is a very strange thing. 

00:57:38.620   00:57:41.740
 This is the chaos that God has wrestled at the beginning of time. 

00:57:42.240   00:57:46.000
 Chaos is semi psychologically, and half is real. 

00:57:46.420   00:57:48.340
 There is no other way to really describe it. 

00:57:49.260   00:57:52.940
 is what you meet when you are deeply confused: 

00:57:53.340   00:57:55.140
 When the world falls down. 

00:57:55.240   00:58:00.060
 When you get to something that breaks you apart, when these dreams die when you're released. 

00:58:00.120   00:58:02.040
 Then chaos came out. 

00:58:02.040   00:58:05.000
 And chaos is all at once, and it's too much for you .. 

00:58:05.320   00:58:08.920
 And that's for sure, pulling you down to the ground 

00:58:08.920   00:58:14.060
 where the dragons, and whatever you have at that moment is to keep your eyes open, 

00:58:14.100   00:58:16.780
 and to speak carefully and clearly as much as you can. 

00:58:16.780   00:58:20.700
 And maybe, if you're lucky, you'll go through it that way, and go to the other side. 

00:58:21.140   00:58:23.960
 And it took people a long time to figure it out. 

00:58:24.020   00:58:26.000
 It seems to me that idea too 

00:58:26.880   00:58:32.320
 raised on the platform of our ancient ancestors, perhaps tens of millions of years ago 

00:58:32.400   00:58:44.600
 Because it seems that we are presenting ourselves to what we do not deeply harbor, using the same system of snake or other predators. 

00:58:44.980   00:58:47.660
 We are biological beings, are not we? 

00:58:48.360   00:58:53.780
 When we have formulated our weird abstraction and use language, 

00:58:53.780   00:58:59.260
 we still have all those sub-systems that were there since we were animals. 

00:58:59.660   00:59:05.780
 And we have to use these systems, they are part of the emotional and motivational architecture of our thinking. 

00:59:06.040   00:59:13.420
 Part of why we can demonize our enemies is because we see them as predators of carnage. 

00:59:13.540   00:59:15.460
 We do it with the same system. 

00:59:15.800   00:59:19.000
 And that is the chaos itself, the thing that always threatens us, right? 

00:59:19.000   00:59:23.520
 The snakes that stem from trees we lived some 60 million years ago. 

00:59:23.520   00:59:25.360
 These are the same systems. 

00:59:26.100   00:59:26.600
 So 

00:59:27.340   00:59:35.980
 The story of Marduk is part of the story of using the power of perception and language to deal with those things that are the greatest threat to us. 

00:59:36.140   00:59:39.700
 And some of these things are a threat to the real world. 

00:59:39.700   00:59:44.400
 But some of them are psychological threats, which are just as deep but far more abstract. 

00:59:44.440   00:59:47.280
 But we use the same systems to show them to ourselves. 

00:59:47.280   00:59:49.360
 So you're kidding when you're scared .. 

00:59:49.700   00:59:52.240
 Is it? You're an animal prey. Rabbity. 

00:59:52.360   00:59:56.040
 You see something that will eat you, you're kidding. 

00:59:56.520   01:00:03.260
 And so you're paralyzed, turned into a stone, what happens when you see a headache with a full snake (Greek mythology) 

01:00:03.260   01:00:05.060
 You're turned into a stone, you're paralyzed. 

01:00:05.460   01:00:12.240
 And the reason you use the predator detection system to protect it. Your heart begins to work faster. 

01:00:12.600   01:00:14.280
 and you are ready to move. 

01:00:16.200   01:00:18.840
 Things that disturb us lie on that system. 

01:00:18.840   01:00:21.540
 And a story, Marduk's story for example 

01:00:21.580   01:00:29.200
 is the idea that if there are things that disturb you; chaotic, horrible, snake monster subterranean things you threaten, 

01:00:29.660   01:00:36.040
 The best you can do is open your eyes wide open, organize your words and come out and face it, and make the world out of it. 

01:00:36.420   01:00:41.900
 And it was just amazing when I read the story and began to understand it, I was simply thrilled. 

01:00:42.100   01:00:50.540
 It's such a deep idea, and we do not know that it's true, eg in psychotherapy, that it is much better for a person when faced with fears 

01:00:50.780   01:00:53.500
 but to wait for them and allow them to find him. 

01:00:53.800   01:01:00.380
 And so, in part, if you are a psyche, you help people to break their fears into small pieces, things that annoy them, 

01:01:00.380   01:01:03.800
 and then to face them and overcome them. 

01:01:03.800   01:01:08.920
 And so learn this process of eternal knowledge of a strange and chaotic world. 

01:01:09.580   01:01:15.260
 And all this makes an introduction, we have not even come to the first sentence of the Bible stories. 

01:01:15.420   01:01:16.700
 [LAUGHTER] 

01:01:16.800   01:01:22.480
 [APPLAUSE] 

01:01:22.480   01:01:24.500
 But all this is an introduction. 

01:01:24.500   01:01:32.860
 You need to think that we've pulled something out of this weird story collection, with all its mistakes, repetitions, 

01:01:32.980   01:01:38.820
 and strange things. We've taken them out of the whole history since we've been collecting ideas. 

01:01:38.840   01:01:41.400
 And that's the best we could do. 

01:01:42.540   01:01:49.160
 I know there are other religious traditions, but I'm not worried about it right now because we can use this as an example. 

01:01:49.220   01:01:58.780
 But the best thing we could do is, and I hope we can go back to these open minded stories and see if there's something we really need. 

01:01:59.060   01:02:02.200
 And I hope it will be so. 

01:02:02.500   01:02:05.440
 As I said, I will approach them as rationally as possible. 

01:02:05.440   01:02:07.660
 This is the idea with which to start. 

01:02:08.480   01:02:12.420
 There is an unknown as such, and we act in the unknown, just as animals are acting. 

01:02:12.840   01:02:16.400
 They first act. They do not think, do not fancy, they only act. 

01:02:16.440   01:02:19.780
 Here we started, with action. 

01:02:19.780   01:02:23.280
 And then we started to be able to describe how we work .. 

01:02:23.280   01:02:26.900
 And then we started to talk about how we describe our actions. 

01:02:26.900   01:02:34.740
 And that made it possible for us to talk about stories because it's a story: the ability to tell about how you pick your actions. 

01:02:35.220   01:02:38.140
 And you know that because when you read the book, what happens? 

01:02:38.260   01:02:43.700
 You read the book and the pictures that come to your head about people in the book and how they behave. 

01:02:43.960   01:02:46.120
 It's a step away from what you've read. 

01:02:46.480   01:02:51.580
 You do not have to do this because you can abstract and show the action without you having to do it. 

01:02:51.840   01:02:55.080
 This is a wonderful thing, and that's part of the development of the prefrontal cortex. 

01:02:55.080   01:03:06.780
 It's part of the human capacity of abstract thinking that you can accept behavior, behavioral behavior, you can move away from behavior and even manipulate the view before you act 

01:03:07.100   01:03:16.300
 So you're thinking so you can create patterns of behavior and test it in your head before you test it in the world and die because you're stupid. 

01:03:16.720   01:03:20.380
 Is it? You let that thoughtful man die you, not you. 

01:03:20.540   01:03:21.700
 And that's why you're thinking. 

01:03:22.080   01:03:24.840
 And that's partly what we are trying to do with these stories. 

01:03:27.860   01:03:29.400
 What do I hope to achieve? 

01:03:30.180   01:03:35.660
 I hope I finish this series of 12 lessons, and I will find out more than when I started 

01:03:36.140   01:03:37.180
 That's my goal. 

01:03:37.180   01:03:42.380
 Therefore, because I told you, I do not speak what I know, I'm trying to figure things out 

01:03:44.820   01:03:48.140
 This is part of the process I'm trying to do. 

01:03:48.140   01:03:51.580
 And I'm doing my best to think on my feet, you know? 

01:03:51.620   01:03:59.420
 I've come prepared, but I try to push to the limit, so that I generate knowledge, and I continually clarify this 

01:03:59.500   01:04:00.960
 And to get to the core. 

01:04:01.600   01:04:05.120
 I hope I will achieve that. 

01:04:05.120   01:04:09.760
 It seems people are interested in it, so we'll try it together. 

01:04:10.720   01:04:12.240
 That's a plan. 

01:04:12.440   01:04:18.980
 The idea to see if there is anything at the heart of this incredible civilization that we have built. 

01:04:21.300   01:04:24.980
 Which I think is in danger for many reasons. 

01:04:25.380   01:04:31.140
 And maybe if we can figure it out a little bit better, we will not be so desperate to dismiss it. 

01:04:31.400   01:04:33.120
 Which I think would be a big mistake. 

01:04:33.540   01:04:42.380
 All this is dismissed because of anger and hatred and bitterness and historical ignorance, jealousy and desires for destruction, and all that. 

01:04:42.520   01:04:44.340
 I do not want to go there .. 

01:04:44.760   01:04:46.520
 The bad idea is to go there. 

01:04:46.900   01:04:48.580
 We need to be ground floor. 

01:04:50.620   01:04:53.420
 We'll see how this will go. 

01:04:54.260   01:04:56.280
 All right, how do I get this? 

01:04:56.760   01:05:00.480
 First of all, I mean in the evolutionary approach, you know? 

01:05:00.520   01:05:07.260
 As far as I'm concerned, the universe is 15 billion years old, and the Earth 4 and a half billion years old. 

01:05:07.400   01:05:16.540
 Life is three and a half billion years old, and living things with a fairly developed nerve system exist 300-600 million years. 

01:05:16.760   01:05:21.320
 We lived in caves as a small mammal 60 million years ago. 

01:05:21.780   01:05:28.140
 We landed on the meadows 60-70 million years ago, and then we were roughly separated from the chimpanzee 

01:05:28.140   01:05:31.980
 Modern human beings seem to have appeared around 150,000 years ago 

01:05:31.980   01:05:37.540
 Civilization was created little after the Ice Age, about 15,000 years ago. 

01:05:37.560   01:05:39.800
 It's not very long, you know that? 

01:05:40.100   01:05:43.980
 And that is the time range I want to understand. 

01:05:44.840   01:05:48.200
 And that is the time range I want to understand. 

01:05:48.760   01:05:55.340
 I want to understand why we are like we are, looking at life and its constant complexity from the beginning of our life. 

01:05:55.660   01:06:04.180
 There is real utility in that, because we share attributes with other animals, albeit simple like crabs and other shells, for example. 

01:06:04.180   01:06:09.600
 They have very similar properties to the nervous system as we do, and it is very worth knowing. 

01:06:09.680   01:06:11.880
 So I think in an evolutionary way. 

01:06:11.880   01:06:17.680
 I think this is a striking way of thinking because it has an incredibly long time span. 

01:06:17.720   01:06:25.420
 It is unbelievable that people from the middle and end of the 19th century, 

01:06:25.420   01:06:28.660
 really thought the world was 6,000 years old. 

01:06:29.580   01:06:37.660
 15 billion years, that's a lot more, is not it? Much more, much larger, but at the same time it can frighten us and alienate, in some sense 

01:06:37.700   01:06:45.500
 Because the universe has become so large, it is easy for people to think for themselves that they are an insignificant small point 

01:06:45.900   01:06:52.980
 in some Dehavas at the end of the galaxy, out of hundreds of millions of other galaxies? 

01:06:53.240   01:06:56.800
 It's easy to see yourself as nothing in that time range. 

01:06:56.840   01:06:58.660
 That's a real challenge for people. 

01:06:58.980   01:07:01.620
 I think it's wrong to think so. 

01:07:02.720   01:07:07.740
 Because I think consciousness is much more than we think, but there is still something we have to fight. 

01:07:09.300   01:07:11.380
 I think psycho-analytically. 

01:07:12.000   01:07:19.140
 And that means I believe in the sub-personality collections, and that these sub-personalities are alive. 

01:07:19.560   01:07:20.760
 They are not machines .. 

01:07:21.040   01:07:28.040
 They have their point of view, their desires, perceptions, arguments, emotions. 

01:07:28.360   01:07:32.520
 They're like a show of you when you're angry at a low resolution. 

01:07:32.520   01:07:35.600
 It's like, it's a small screen resolution. 

01:07:35.720   01:07:41.740
 He just wants rage, or wants to eat, or just wants water, or just wants sex. 

01:07:42.020   01:07:45.780
 That's you, just reduced and focused in the exact direction. 

01:07:46.260   01:07:53.260
 And these motivational systems are very, very ancient, archaic and very, very powerful. 

01:07:53.260   01:07:57.880
 And they play a key role in the way we manifest ourselves. 

01:07:57.900   01:08:05.840
 And, as Freud pointed out, we need to find ways of all these animalistic motivations and emotions 

01:08:06.100   01:08:17.720
 civilization in a way so that we can all live in the same territory without breaking into pieces, which is perhaps the starting point for people and chimpanzees. 

01:08:19.780   01:08:24.280
 So let me take it seriously, the idea that we are a loose collection of personalities. 

01:08:26.400   01:08:32.060
 You know, in the Old Testament some say that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, and I think this is similar to that 

01:08:32.060   01:08:38.300
 Know that you are not in complete control, that there are other factors in the game. 

01:08:38.300   01:08:43.060
 For example, the Greeks thought they were people of toys with which gods play. 

01:08:43.060   01:08:45.220
 this is the way they perceive the world. 

01:08:45.400   01:08:52.380
 And that was about the same. it is said that there are some larger forces that drive us, which we do not create on our own. 

01:08:52.380   01:08:59.080
 If we were subordinate, in some sense. Not entirely, but we can be subordinate to them, and they are pushing our destiny. 

01:08:59.300   01:09:01.620
 That was a Greek look at the world, and that's something ... 

01:09:03.120   01:09:05.640
 Understand it, teach you humility. 

01:09:06.000   01:09:13.520
 That there is much to happen behind the curtain, and you are a driver of a very complex vehicle, only by not understanding the vehicle very well. 

01:09:13.840   01:09:21.280
 And he has his own motivations and methods, and sometimes you think he's doing one thing, and the honor is something else. 

01:09:21.600   01:09:28.320
 We see it in psychotherapy all the time because you're trying to help someone understand the pattern of behavior they have used forever. 

01:09:28.700   01:09:33.120
 First they describe it, then become aware of it, and may begin to understand what the cause is. 

01:09:33.120   01:09:35.320
 They had no idea why they behaved like that. 

01:09:35.540   01:09:40.760
 You know, there should be a memory that would produce such patterns of behavior. 

01:09:40.760   01:09:47.480
 You need to become aware of it and then it needs to be analyzed and evaluated, and then you have to start thinking about another way of behaving 

01:09:47.600   01:09:49.760
 It is uncommonly complex. 

01:09:50.160   01:09:52.920
 So, psychoanalyst. 

01:09:53.020   01:09:53.800
 Verbatim. 

01:09:54.620   01:09:55.120
 And, 

01:09:58.020   01:10:05.920
 There is a new postmodernist movement that has its own idea in literature, and the world as we are already in it. 

01:10:07.180   01:10:11.500
 that you can take a complex work of literature, such as Shakespeare's drama .. 

01:10:11.500   01:10:15.080
 There is no end to the number of interpretations you can draw from the drama. 

01:10:15.080   01:10:20.580
 You know, you can interpret every word in a phrase, every paragraph. 

01:10:20.580   01:10:22.180
 You can interpret the whole drama. 

01:10:22.180   01:10:28.040
 The way you interpret it depends on how much of a book you read, about where you are in the world 

01:10:28.220   01:10:34.780
 depends on many, many things. How much are you cultural, or not cultural. 

01:10:34.980   01:10:36.040
 About all this. 

01:10:36.280   01:10:40.300
 Many doors open for potential interpretations. 

01:10:40.340   01:10:49.240
 And so the postmodernists stuck to that idea: Well, if there are so many interpretations for any piece of literature 

01:10:49.240   01:10:53.640
 How can you be sure that any interpretation is better than someone else? 

01:10:53.640   01:10:57.040
 And if you can not be sure, how can you even know that these are great works of literature? 

01:10:57.200   01:10:58.060
 How do you know ... 

01:10:58.440   01:11:05.440
 Perhaps it was only the people who made the power to maintain their constant access to power. 

01:11:05.500   01:11:11.500
 which is actually a post-modernist idea, very cynical, but stands out. 

01:11:11.500   01:11:13.620
 But the thing is, the story is based on something, is not it? 

01:11:13.620   01:11:16.020
 It's like, yes, you can forever interpret something .. 

01:11:16.020   01:11:18.920
 I just want to show you something. 

01:11:18.940   01:11:20.160
 We'll be back on this later. 

01:11:20.240   01:11:21.120
 Look at this. 

01:11:21.120   01:11:23.720
 This is one of the best things I've ever seen. 

01:11:23.880   01:11:29.140
 So here at the bottom, each of these lines is a verse from the Bible. 

01:11:29.660   01:11:30.160
 Alright? 

01:11:31.500   01:11:38.700
 Now, the length of the line is proportional to how many times a verse related another verse. 

01:11:41.680   01:11:44.440
 so you see this is the first hyperlink book. 

01:11:44.560   01:11:45.340
 [LAUGHTER] 

01:11:45.340   01:11:47.660
 Is it? I'm dead serious! 

01:11:47.680   01:11:54.340
 You can not click and go to the hyperlink, of course, but it's a hyperlink book detail, because the people who worked on these stories 

01:11:54.340   01:11:56.100
 who are hypothetical in the end? 

01:11:56.200   01:12:01.240
 The end can not affect the beginning. That's the rule of time, right? 

01:12:01.240   01:12:06.900
 What is happening now can not affect what happened 10 years ago, though it can actually, but nevertheless. 

01:12:06.940   01:12:07.740
 [LAUGHTER] 

01:12:07.740   01:12:12.260
 Well, you reinterpret things, are not they, and then they are not the same again, but anyway, we will not enter it now. 

01:12:12.500   01:12:19.720
 Technically speaking, the present can not change the past, but if you look at the works of literature, it is not so. 

01:12:19.980   01:12:25.280
 Because when you write down, you know what was at the beginning, and when you start editing the book and doing the beginning, you know what the end is. 

01:12:25.580   01:12:27.840
 So you can link everything 

01:12:27.840   01:12:32.400
 And there are 65,000 times that the verse refers to another, and this is what this map is showing. 

01:12:32.700   01:12:35.380
 So this is a great visual display of this book. 

01:12:35.560   01:12:38.440
 And then what can you see, why is it so deep? Why is the book deep? 

01:12:38.760   01:12:41.720
 Well, just imagine how many routes you can choose through. 

01:12:42.040   01:12:46.840
 Is it? They would travel infinitely through it, never come to an end. 

01:12:47.320   01:12:53.680
 There are permutations and combinations, each phrase is dependent on each other, and each verse is dependent on each other, not entirely 

01:12:53.780   01:12:57.440
 not entirely, but 65 thousand is a good start. 

01:12:58.200   01:12:58.700
 And so 

01:13:01.120   01:13:08.420
 OK, there is another problem that makes postmodernist criticism accurate. 

01:13:08.420   01:13:12.720
 How will you derive a consistent interpretation of something like TOG? 

01:13:13.060   01:13:14.180
 Like, it's not possible. 

01:13:14.540   01:13:17.460
 But here's the problem, how much I can see. 

01:13:18.060   01:13:21.640
 Post-modernists have extended this critique to the world. 

01:13:21.640   01:13:26.340
 They said, you see, the text is complicated enough that you can not derive a consistent interpretation: 

01:13:26.440   01:13:27.880
 What about the world? 

01:13:28.260   01:13:30.260
 The world is much more complicated than some text. 

01:13:30.260   01:13:33.740
 So you have the infinite ways you can look to the world. 

01:13:33.740   01:13:36.980
 And how do you know that one's way of looking at the world is better than someone else? 

01:13:37.320   01:13:38.720
 That's a good question. 

01:13:40.660   01:13:42.940
 The post modernist answer is: we can not. 

01:13:43.480   01:13:48.080
 but this is not a good answer, because it would drown into chaos in these circumstances. 

01:13:48.080   01:13:49.380
 It would not make sense in anything. 

01:13:49.580   01:13:51.020
 And that is not good because 

01:13:53.120   01:13:56.080
 Do not find sense in nothing is neutral. 

01:13:56.820   01:13:58.900
 It's a very anxious feeling. 

01:13:59.500   01:14:06.500
 It's very depressing because if things are so chaotic that you can not fight with them, your body falls into emergency preparations. 

01:14:06.840   01:14:15.880
 The heart's work accelerates, the immune system stops working and burns, grows fast because you are not surrounded by what's in your control. 

01:14:15.880   01:14:21.760
 It's an existential crisis, is not it? It causes anxiety and depression, very difficult for people. 

01:14:22.040   01:14:29.380
 And moreover, it turns out that the way we are built neurophysiologically is that we can not experience any positive emotion 

01:14:29.560   01:14:31.000
 unless we have a goal, 

01:14:32.520   01:14:35.160
 and if we see ourselves progressing toward that goal. 

01:14:35.640   01:14:39.480
 It is not so true that reaching this goal makes us happy. 

01:14:40.400   01:14:45.900
 As you all know if you've ever wanted to achieve something, as soon as you get there, the whole little game ends. 

01:14:45.900   01:14:47.680
 and you have to figure out another game. 

01:14:48.100   01:14:49.780
 So, Sisyph. 

01:14:50.140   01:14:51.260
 And that's fine. 

01:14:51.260   01:14:56.380
 But it shows that achievement is not what drives you, because it ends the game .. 

01:14:56.380   01:14:58.380
 This happens when you graduate. 

01:14:58.400   01:15:06.620
 Something like, you're a mountain king one day, and then you are a servant in the Starbucks cafe for the next 5 years, you know? 

01:15:06.700   01:15:07.500
 [LAUGHTER] 

01:15:09.180   01:15:18.080
 And what happens is that people are weird creatures that are much more active when they have the goal and when they move toward it, rather than with the actual achievement of the goal. 

01:15:18.080   01:15:22.180
 And what that means is that you have to have a goal, and that means you have to have an interpretation. 

01:15:22.180   01:15:27.960
 It also means that the more noble goal, the better your life. 

01:15:28.460   01:15:35.860
 And it's really interesting to know because, since you've been little listening to how to behave like a good person, and for example you should not lie 

01:15:35.860   01:15:40.920
 And he might think, so why the hell should I behave like a good person and why not lie? 

01:15:40.920   01:15:46.360
 I mean, even a three-year-old can ask you, because smart kids learn to lie earlier, by the way. 

01:15:46.680   01:15:54.140
 And they think, why not distort the reality if they serve their short-term goals? 

01:15:54.140   01:15:56.340
 And that's a big question, why not do it? 

01:15:56.340   01:16:01.760
 Why to act morally, if you can get out and bring you closer to what you want? 

01:16:01.760   01:16:03.220
 So why not do it? 

01:16:03.500   01:16:06.360
 These are good questions and it is not obvious what the answer is. 

01:16:06.440   01:16:10.040
 Well, it seems to me related to what I just mentioned. 

01:16:10.040   01:16:14.140
 If you destabilize yourself and things become chaotic, that's not good. 

01:16:14.240   01:16:21.500
 And if you do not have a noble goal then you have nothing but shallow, low pleasures. 

01:16:21.660   01:16:23.760
 And that can not keep you. 

01:16:23.760   01:16:29.840
 Not because life is so difficult, so much suffering, so complicated. 

01:16:29.900   01:16:32.740
 It ends, everything dies, and it's a pain. 

01:16:33.060   01:16:36.380
 Without a noble goal, how could it ever endure it all? 

01:16:36.700   01:16:37.420
 You can not. 

01:16:37.420   01:16:43.580
 You become desperate, and once you become desperate, things go from worse to bad very quickly. 

01:16:44.180   01:16:46.820
 So that's the idea of ​​a noble goal. 

01:16:47.060   01:16:50.300
 And that is something that is necessary. 

01:16:50.300   01:16:52.480
 Bread is what people can not live without, do not they? 

01:16:52.480   01:16:55.480
 and that is not physical bread. This is a noble goal. 

01:16:55.540   01:16:56.660
 And what is it? 

01:16:57.080   01:16:57.580
 And, 

01:16:58.200   01:17:00.720
 This is partly perpetuated in the story of Marduk. 

01:17:00.900   01:17:08.460
 Pay attention, speak right, face chaos, make a better world. Something like that. 

01:17:09.000   01:17:21.420
 And that is a noble goal that you can stand upright without regret the pain of your existence, that you can do something that can justify your sad position on the planet. 

01:17:22.060   01:17:25.120
 the problem with the literature is that ... 

01:17:26.520   01:17:27.020
 Look, 

01:17:28.280   01:17:31.820
 you take text, you can interpret it in a variety of ways, but that is not the case 

01:17:31.820   01:17:34.200
 Here the postmodernists are mistaken because 

01:17:35.380   01:17:41.460
 what you are looking for in the book, and in fact in the world, is a sufficient order and direction. 

01:17:41.900   01:17:45.600
 Well, when we think, what does the right order and direction mean? 

01:17:45.600   01:17:49.640
 Well, you do not want to suffer so much that your life is unbearable? 

01:17:49.800   01:17:51.220
 That seems to be obvious. 

01:17:51.400   01:17:54.180
 Suffering has its own arguments. 

01:17:54.760   01:17:59.000
 I think pain is a fundamental reality, because no one can contradict it, right? 

01:17:59.420   01:18:04.320
 Even if you say you do not believe in pain, it does not help when it hurts. 

01:18:04.580   01:18:05.820
 You still trust her 

01:18:07.100   01:18:10.900
 You can not ignore it with logic and rationality. 

01:18:10.900   01:18:14.180
 It exists only as the foundation of existence. 

01:18:14.180   01:18:16.340
 And that is actually very useful to know. 

01:18:16.560   01:18:20.000
 You say, I do not want it any more, but absolutely necessary. 

01:18:20.120   01:18:22.000
 And I think that's obvious. 

01:18:22.000   01:18:24.340
 And then you say, wait a little bit, it's more complicated than that. 

01:18:24.800   01:18:31.800
 you do not want more suffering than you need today, but you also do not want it tomorrow, next week, next month, next year 

01:18:31.900   01:18:36.820
 So whatever you are doing now, you better not be in danger of being in a year. 

01:18:37.140   01:18:38.740
 It's simply because it's counter-productive. 

01:18:38.740   01:18:41.620
 It's part of the problem with short-term pleasure, is not it? 

01:18:42.520   01:18:44.480
 If you're doing something hard, you'll be back in time. 

01:18:44.480   01:18:46.420
 Everyone knows exactly what this means. 

01:18:46.420   01:18:51.520
 So it should work in a way that is good for now. and tomorrow, and next week. next month, etc. 

01:18:51.520   01:18:54.100
 So you have to consider yourself in the future .. 

01:18:54.520   01:18:56.100
 And people can do it. 

01:18:56.100   01:19:01.040
 Taking your own future into consideration is not much different than taking other people into account. 

01:19:02.360   01:19:05.160
 I remember the episode of Simpsons. 

01:19:05.620   01:19:09.920
 Where Homer dropped a quarter of a bottle of mayonnaise and vodka. 

01:19:09.980   01:19:12.140
 [LAUGHTER] 

01:19:12.400   01:19:13.120
 And says 

01:19:15.440   01:19:17.860
 Marge (Homer's wife) says, so she should not do it. 

01:19:17.860   01:19:20.720
 Homer says: this is a problem for the future Homer. 

01:19:20.800   01:19:23.980
 I'm so glad I'm not that character. 

01:19:24.080   01:19:24.880
 [LAUGHTER] 

01:19:28.160   01:19:30.180
 It's so funny, it caught me, you know? 

01:19:30.500   01:19:37.500
 But you see, we have to fight it, so it's my own future, in one way as another person. 

01:19:37.740   01:19:46.800
 And understanding how to behave towards my own future is not much different from understanding how to behave towards other people. 

01:19:47.000   01:19:49.100
 And then we can extend that boundary. 

01:19:49.640   01:19:57.740
 Not only does this interpretation you draw out of should protect you from suffering and give you the goal, but must do it in a way that is unmistakable. 

01:19:58.540   01:20:05.500
 so it's working over time, and you should work in the presence of other people so you can collaborate and compete with them. 

01:20:05.500   01:20:07.660
 In a way you will not suffer the extra time needed. 

01:20:07.780   01:20:10.900
 And people are not so tolerant. 

01:20:11.680   01:20:14.620
 They have a choice, they do not have to hang out with you. 

01:20:14.620   01:20:16.840
 I can socialize with any of the other primates. 

01:20:16.840   01:20:22.940
 So if you do not act right, at least within certain limits, you're just dropped from the side. 

01:20:23.340   01:20:30.300
 So people are non-stop transmitting information on how to prophesy the world so they can tolerate being close to you. 

01:20:30.660   01:20:34.620
 And we need that, because it's socially isolated, you're out of bed, then you die. 

01:20:34.620   01:20:38.160
 No one can tolerate being alone any time. 

01:20:38.160   01:20:44.120
 We can not maintain our mental health without the constant return of information from other people, because it is complicated. 

01:20:44.420   01:20:49.720
 So you are limited by your own existence, and by the existence of other people. 

01:20:49.720   01:20:51.860
 And then, you're also restricted to the world. 

01:20:52.100   01:21:02.800
 If I read Hamlet, and what I get out of it is that it should be thrown off the bridge, it becomes very fast to the end of my interpretation. 

01:21:02.800   01:21:06.480
 Does not look functional. 

01:21:06.940   01:21:11.500
 So the interpretation is limited by the reality of the world. 

01:21:11.500   01:21:13.600
 It is limited by the reality of other people 

01:21:13.600   01:21:16.560
 It's limited to your reality through time. 

01:21:16.600   01:21:22.660
 there are only a few interpretations that can fit into such a limited space .. 

01:21:22.980   01:21:26.440
 And that's part of why the postmodernists are wrong .. 

01:21:26.880   01:21:32.780
 This is also part of the reason, by the way, that people who are dealing with artificial intelligence have to give robots to the body to put intelligence into it. 

01:21:33.400   01:21:37.820
 Because it turns out you can not just do something intelligent if it's not embedded in something. 

01:21:37.820   01:21:40.320
 Part for the reasons I just described. 

01:21:40.340   01:21:44.000
 Some systems need limitations 

01:21:44.800   01:21:50.260
 that this system does not drown in the sea of ​​interpretation. 

01:21:50.360   01:21:51.800
 Something like that. 

01:21:52.040   01:21:54.200
 There is therefore a part of the story of literature. 

01:21:54.260   01:21:54.900
 Morals... 

01:21:56.300   01:21:58.460
 Well, morality is for me to act. 

01:21:58.460   01:22:00.780
 I'm an existentialist in one way. 

01:22:00.780   01:22:07.040
 And what that means is that I believe that what they love is that they think it is true, they show the act, not the words. 

01:22:07.820   01:22:09.700
 There are many definitions of truth. 

01:22:09.700   01:22:11.760
 I mean, the truth is the word that can spread. 

01:22:11.800   01:22:17.280
 You can think of objective truth, but truth in behavior is not the same as the objective truth. 

01:22:17.520   01:22:20.400
 How should it behave is not the same as the question: What is it? 

01:22:20.580   01:22:22.540
 At least as far as I can tell, but people are arguing about it. 

01:22:22.540   01:22:26.360
 and I think that's why ... 

01:22:26.660   01:22:27.860
 Think about it this way. 

01:22:27.980   01:22:29.680
 Stand in front of the field. 

01:22:30.540   01:22:31.980
 And you can see the field. 

01:22:32.440   01:22:34.720
 But the field does not tell you how to go through it. 

01:22:35.220   01:22:37.980
 There is an infinite number of ways you can go through the field. 

01:22:38.540   01:22:45.540
 So you can not get the best way to behave from the many facts that are ahead of you. 

01:22:45.540   01:22:47.340
 Because it's too much of a fact. 

01:22:47.860   01:22:49.540
 And they have no orientation. 

01:22:49.780   01:22:51.320
 But you, you need to know. 

01:22:51.320   01:22:53.140
 You need to know how to not suffer. 

01:22:53.160   01:22:55.520
 And you need to be your target. 

01:22:55.740   01:23:00.320
 so you have to cover that objective reality with some interpretation. 

01:23:00.480   01:23:04.460
 And the nature of the structure of interpretation is what we are aiming for. 

01:23:04.460   01:23:06.100
 I already gave some insight about it .. 

01:23:06.100   01:23:10.980
 We were pulled out of the observation of our own behavior and the behavior of others. 

01:23:10.980   01:23:17.440
 And we pulled it out part of the nature of our bodies that were shaped for millions of years. 

01:23:17.800   01:23:23.580
 We see an infinite field of fact and we need a moral interpretation of it. 

01:23:23.580   01:23:27.540
 And a moral interpretation is: What to do with what it is? 

01:23:28.000   01:23:32.900
 and this is related to our security, because you do not need much complexity, 

01:23:33.040   01:23:34.240
 And also for the purpose. 

01:23:34.340   01:23:36.140
 We're moving creatures, are not we? 

01:23:36.140   01:23:37.940
 We need to know where we are going. 

01:23:37.940   01:23:42.780
 Because only because we are always concerned is the question: Where are we going ?. 

01:23:42.960   01:23:44.360
 That's what we need to know. 

01:23:44.360   01:23:46.480
 Where are we going, what do we do and why? 

01:23:47.040   01:23:51.260
 And that is not the same question as; What is the world made of? 

01:23:51.560   01:23:53.840
 This is a different question and requires a different answer. 

01:23:54.720   01:23:59.260
 And that is the domain of morals; What is your goal? 

01:23:59.920   01:24:02.680
 This is also the question of the ultimate ideal, in one way. 

01:24:02.760   01:24:12.560
 Even if you have tiny, trivial ideals, it's just below what it's trying to run out of, and it's much more connected and blended. 

01:24:12.820   01:24:15.540
 More Applicable and Practical .. 

01:24:15.920   01:24:17.360
 And that is the other thing, and that is .. 

01:24:18.500   01:24:23.820
 You know when you're thinking about literature or art, you do not think that's not the stuff with the legs on the ground. 

01:24:23.820   01:24:28.300
 They are spiritual, somewhere in the air, and they do not seem practical. 

01:24:28.360   01:24:30.780
 But I'm a practical person. 

01:24:31.580   01:24:38.340
 And part of the reason why I want to evaluate these books from the aesthetic, evolutionary and literary point of view is 

01:24:38.340   01:24:43.600
 to get something worthwhile, something right, practical value. 

01:24:43.960   01:24:48.380
 You know? Something, because one of my rules while I submit 

01:24:48.840   01:24:51.540
 I do not want to tell anyone anything I can not use. 

01:24:51.980   01:24:53.800
 Because I mean knowledge as a tool. 

01:24:53.920   01:24:56.120
 Something to incorporate into the world. 

01:24:56.120   01:24:59.440
 We are creatures that use tools, and our knowledge is a tool. 

01:24:59.720   01:25:01.540
 And we need tools to be able to work. 

01:25:01.540   01:25:07.560
 We need the tools to regulate our own emotions, do something good, and stop suffering as much as we can 

01:25:07.680   01:25:11.300
 And we can live normally with ourselves. and we can stand upright. 

01:25:11.660   01:25:13.280
 And we need the tools to do that. 

01:25:13.820   01:25:18.280
 So I do not want to do anything in this series of lectures that is not practical. 

01:25:18.600   01:25:24.560
 I want you to go out of here with related thoughts, so that you can apply it immediately. 

01:25:24.560   01:25:28.560
 Do not bother interested in abstraction just because it is an abstraction .. 

01:25:29.400   01:25:30.040
 Rationally. 

01:25:30.380   01:25:33.460
 Well, it will make sense, you know? Because.. 

01:25:36.260   01:25:39.020
 The more restrictions on your theory, the better. 

01:25:39.880   01:25:40.520
 So... 

01:25:42.560   01:25:49.880
 I want to introduce this to you so that B follows A and in front of C, 

01:25:50.180   01:25:53.680
 in a manner that is understandable and does not require a jump 

01:25:54.260   01:25:56.340
 any unnecessary leap of faith. 

01:25:56.700   01:26:03.160
 because I think this is another thing that contradicts our relationship with a collection of books like the Bible. 

01:26:03.160   01:26:07.380
 That you have to believe something that no one can trust. 

01:26:07.780   01:26:10.920
 And that's not good because it's a form of lies, as far as I can tell. 

01:26:10.920   01:26:14.880
 And then you have to dismiss the whole thing, because in principle everything revolves around the truth. 

01:26:14.880   01:26:20.880
 and if you have to start pursuing the pursuit of faith by guilty of lies where will you end up? 

01:26:21.800   01:26:25.400
 So I do not want any uncertainty about this. 

01:26:25.480   01:26:29.460
 Or, I do not want more than I leave it. 

01:26:29.460   01:26:31.760
 Because I can not go any further. 

01:26:32.040   01:26:34.900
 So they will have a rational sense .. 

01:26:35.120   01:26:42.780
 I do not want to push anything that we know is scientifically inaccurate, although we know that scientific facts are changing. 

01:26:42.780   01:26:45.900
 And that's a pretty dangerous parameter. 

01:26:46.020   01:26:52.540
 If it does not agree with evolutionary theory, then I do not think it's a good enough solution. 

01:26:53.060   01:26:53.560
 So.. 

01:26:55.240   01:26:57.660
 Well then, finally, it's also phenomenological .. 

01:26:59.920   01:27:05.000
 We modern humans, you know, think for the reality that it is objective. 

01:27:05.520   01:27:07.280
 And that's very powerful. 

01:27:07.640   01:27:10.100
 But this is not how we experience reality. 

01:27:11.280   01:27:13.520
 We have our domain of experience. 

01:27:14.300   01:27:19.420
 And this is very difficult to understand, although this is a very obvious thing .. 

01:27:19.940   01:27:23.100
 For phenomenologists, all we experience is really .. 

01:27:24.100   01:27:31.720
 They are interested in the structure of your subjective experience, and you say, so you have subjective experiences, both you and you. 

01:27:31.980   01:27:35.100
 And there are common things between all these experiences. 

01:27:35.300   01:27:38.880
 For example, it is very likely that you will all experience the same set of emotions. 

01:27:38.880   01:27:42.000
 We have succeeded in identifying the emotions that are in everyone. 

01:27:42.000   01:27:47.980
 Likewise, motivations, without that, would not be able to communicate because they would not know what other people are. 

01:27:47.980   01:27:49.920
 should be explained below. 

01:27:49.920   01:27:52.340
 There would be nothing you could take for granted. But you can .. 

01:27:52.640   01:27:59.760
 And phenomenology is the fact that, in the center of my vision, my arms are very clean and clear, and then on the periphery of my vision are slowly disappearing. 

01:28:00.180   01:28:05.020
 And phenomenology is the way things smell, they have the taste, and the fact they mean something. 

01:28:05.180   01:28:12.020
 So you can say that phenomenology is in one sense, a study of what it means, 

01:28:12.180   01:28:13.240
 rather than something. 

01:28:13.720   01:28:18.340
 and from the phenomenological perspective these things have meaning. 

01:28:18.920   01:28:26.200
 And even if you're cynical, nihilistic, and you say nothing is meaningful 

01:28:26.300   01:28:28.640
 you will regret the pain problem again. 

01:28:28.880   01:28:32.280
 Because pain cuts through your arguments and has meaning. 

01:28:32.660   01:28:38.140
 So there is no escape from meaning, you can break all the positive things of meaning 

01:28:38.520   01:28:43.260
 but trying to find out the negative things, man, good luck, because it just will not fire. 

01:28:43.780   01:28:44.280
 Therefore.. 

01:28:45.700   01:28:52.320
 For Bible stories I think this is true, as well as fiction in general, that they are phenomenological. 

01:28:56.040   01:29:02.400
 It tries to draw the nature of human existence, and it is not the same as the objective world. 

01:29:02.600   01:29:08.760
 But this is the same form of truth, because it is true that you have a field of experience, and that these experiences have their own qualities. 

01:29:08.760   01:29:10.720
 The question is what are these qualities? 

01:29:10.980   01:29:21.840
 Now, the ancient portrayal of reality was a weird mixture of phenomena we can observe, things that I would regard as objective facts and subjective truths, 

01:29:21.840   01:29:23.520
 projections of subjective truths. 

01:29:23.520   01:29:25.420
 I'll show you for example, 

01:29:26.260   01:29:29.480
 how the Mesopotamians saw the world. 

01:29:29.640   01:29:31.780
 They had a model. 

01:29:31.780   01:29:33.500
 practically, the world was a flat disk - disk. 

01:29:33.500   01:29:37.380
 You know, when you go out into the field in the night, how does the world look? 

01:29:37.840   01:29:38.640
 Looks like a disk. 

01:29:39.260   01:29:40.700
 It has a dome on top. 

01:29:41.220   01:29:44.120
 Well, that was how the Mesopotamians saw the world .. 

01:29:44.120   01:29:47.940
 And the people who wrote the first stories in the Bible saw the world as well. 

01:29:47.940   01:29:50.440
 And on top of that dome, it was water. 

01:29:50.440   01:29:52.500
 Well, obviously, because it's raining, right? 

01:29:52.500   01:29:53.620
 Where does water come from? 

01:29:53.920   01:29:55.680
 And then, water is around the dome. 

01:29:56.100   01:29:58.160
 And finally there is the mainland, ie the disc .. 

01:29:58.160   01:29:59.780
 And below all that is water. 

01:29:59.780   01:30:00.900
 How do you know that? 

01:30:01.040   01:30:03.400
 Well, fuck! You're gonna get on the water .. 

01:30:03.480   01:30:06.940
 Below the ground, apparently, because otherwise he would come across the water? 

01:30:07.100   01:30:08.800
 And what's under it? Drinking water.. 

01:30:08.900   01:30:12.540
 And what's under it? Well, if you're going to the edge of the disc, you'll run into the ocean. 

01:30:12.560   01:30:17.800
 Saltwater. So it is a dome, with water outside, 

01:30:18.440   01:30:24.580
 And then this is the disk where the dome stands. Below it is sweet water, below which is salt water. 

01:30:24.860   01:30:27.120
 And that was roughly the world of Mesopotamians. 

01:30:27.180   01:30:32.420
 You see, it's a mix of observation and imagination, right? 

01:30:32.420   01:30:36.540
 because it's not the world, but it's the way the world looks. 

01:30:37.060   01:30:39.780
 It's a perfectly convincing cosmology. 

01:30:40.700   01:30:44.180
 The sun rises and sits on the dome .. 

01:30:44.180   01:30:47.380
 Not that the whole thing is turning, who would have thought it at all? 

01:30:47.660   01:30:53.500
 It is obvious that the force goes up and down and then travels below the ground, and returns again .. 

01:30:53.740   01:30:55.800
 There is nothing clearer than that. 

01:30:56.180   01:31:05.040
 Well, that's a weird blend of subjective fantasy, say, and the phenomena we can observe. 

01:31:05.040   01:31:09.860
 And many cosmologies associated with Bible stories are just like that. 

01:31:09.940   01:31:14.920
 ITo is half the psychology, and half the reality. 

01:31:15.300   01:31:17.340
 although psychology is also real. 

01:31:20.100   01:31:26.180
 And knowing that biblical stories contain the phenomenological truth really worth knowing because 

01:31:27.540   01:31:34.300
 you know, poor fundamelists, trying to stick to their moral structure, you know, understand why. 

01:31:34.720   01:31:39.740
 Because it organizes their society, and their psyche, and they have something to catch. 

01:31:39.860   01:31:46.060
 but you know, they do not have a very sophisticated idea of ​​the complexity of what embodies the truth. 

01:31:46.060   01:31:51.780
 and trying to convey Bible stories to the domain of scientific theory, you know? 

01:31:54.300   01:31:58.180
 Promoting Creationism, for example, as an alternative scientific theory .. 

01:31:58.180   01:32:00.760
 It will not take you one by one, you know? 

01:32:00.960   01:32:05.080
 Because the people who wrote these stories were not scientists at all. 

01:32:05.080   01:32:07.160
 Scientists did not even exist at that time. 

01:32:07.300   01:32:09.840
 There are very few scientists today. [LAUGHTER] 

01:32:09.840   01:32:14.600
 It's what he really is! It's hard to think scientifically, so there is a lot of training. 

01:32:14.600   01:32:18.500
 and even scientists do not matter, think scientifically as soon as you get them out of the lab. 

01:32:18.500   01:32:20.680
 And even when they're in the lab, you know that? 

01:32:20.680   01:32:25.120
 Someone has to examine it, and criticize it, and it is very difficult to think scientifically. 

01:32:25.540   01:32:31.040
 So, the people who talked about these stories have been thinking more of dramas, they are thinking more like Shakespeare. 

01:32:31.040   01:32:37.580
 But that does not mean that there is no truth in them, it just means you have to be a bit more refined about your idea of ​​truth. 

01:32:37.580   01:32:39.000
 And that's fine, you know? 

01:32:39.180   01:32:41.340
 These are the truths that should live! 

01:32:42.020   01:32:47.280
 All right, well, now we want to understand what the truth is, so we need to live and maybe not suffer so much. 

01:32:49.280   01:32:57.560
 So you may know that Bible stories and stories generally try to show the experienced experience of conscious individuals. 

01:32:57.980   01:33:06.080
 The structure of the experienced experiences of conscious individuals, and then it opens up the possibility of another domain of understanding. 

01:33:06.240   01:33:14.220
 It also eliminates the contradiction that has been painful for people, between the objective wit, and, say, the allegations of religious stories. 

01:33:16.520   01:33:20.060
 All right, let's look at the very structure of the book .. 

01:33:20.780   01:33:23.380
 The first thing about the Bible is that it's a comedy. 

01:33:24.120   01:33:26.100
 And comedy is a drama with a happy ending, is not it? (The Greeks shared a comedy drama-a happy ending, and a triad-sad place) 

01:33:26.380   01:33:31.320
 This is a strange thing, because in ancient Greece stories of gods almost always ended tragically. 

01:33:31.780   01:33:33.540
 So the Bible is a comedy. 

01:33:34.040   01:33:37.040
 She has a happy ending. Everyone is alive. There is a paradise. 

01:33:37.360   01:33:40.940
 Now, what you think about this is a completely different story. 

01:33:40.940   01:33:43.060
 I'm just telling the story structure .. 

01:33:43.060   01:33:45.940
 Here's some pout of this: There was Paradise at the beginning of time, 

01:33:46.700   01:33:54.060
 then cataclysms occurred, and people started history, and history is the limitation of mortality and suffering and self-awareness. 

01:33:54.340   01:33:59.820
 But there is a model of living, or potentially a model of the state that will overcome it. 

01:34:00.360   01:34:02.180
 And that's actually the goal of time. 

01:34:02.460   01:34:05.180
 That is, the idea of ​​the story, you know? 

01:34:05.380   01:34:10.960
 It's strange how the Bible has a story, but it's not written like a book, right? 

01:34:10.960   01:34:13.860
 It's made up of a whole bunch of different books. 

01:34:13.860   01:34:19.000
 And the fact that it is made up to something similar to the story is truly unbelievable. 

01:34:21.400   01:34:24.240
 And then the question is asked, so what's the story about? 

01:34:24.460   01:34:26.540
 And how did it come about as a story? 

01:34:26.700   01:34:28.820
 And then, I guess, the question is: Is there anything in it? 

01:34:29.120   01:34:34.480
 It consists of dramatic records of self-realization or abstraction, as I have already mentioned. 

01:34:35.340   01:34:43.120
 The idea of, for example, the image of God, as abstractions, we will consider it to be the beginning. 

01:34:43.540   01:34:49.440
 Although I want to say first, because I have already said I will not reduce the story more than necessary. 

01:34:49.940   01:34:56.120
 I know that the evidence for the primordial religious experience is indisputable .. 

01:34:56.420   01:34:58.100
 But that is not understandable. 

01:34:58.640   01:35:01.900
 so I do not want to explain it in depth, I want to leave it here as a fact .. 

01:35:02.500   01:35:06.640
 And then, I want to pull a little out of it and say, okay, we'll leave it here as a fact, and as a secret. 

01:35:07.180   01:35:16.280
 But I want to look from a rational perspective and to say that the original formulation of God was an attempt to extract the ideal, 

01:35:16.740   01:35:21.760
 and to consider it as an abstraction beyond its incarnation. 

01:35:21.760   01:35:25.700
 And, that's good enough. That's an amazing thing if it's true. 

01:35:25.920   01:35:26.860
 But I do not want to 

01:35:28.460   01:35:30.400
 throw all the wind down, if anything is important in that. 

01:35:30.820   01:35:34.040
 It's a set of books, with multiple editors and directors. 

01:35:34.040   01:35:35.300
 Well, what does that mean? 

01:35:35.340   01:35:36.600
 Many people wrote that. 

01:35:37.200   01:35:38.800
 There are many different books. 

01:35:38.800   01:35:42.380
 And they are all interconnected, especially in the first 5 books, 

01:35:42.720   01:35:46.400
 by people, who I think 

01:35:47.180   01:35:53.900
 took the tradition of tribes that were united under one political organization, 

01:35:53.900   01:35:56.520
 and tried to link their stories to a coherent structure. 

01:35:57.000   01:36:01.280
 So they took a little of this, little to that, a little bit of this. 

01:36:01.300   01:36:07.520
 And they tried to lose nothing, because it seemed valuable, it was certainly worth it to people who collected stories. 

01:36:07.520   01:36:11.500
 They were not ready, you know, the story is too much edited. 

01:36:11.820   01:36:19.980
 But they also wanted to make sense, to some extent, so as not to be totally contradictory logic and completely absurd 

01:36:20.400   01:36:22.720
 So many people wrote that. 

01:36:23.320   01:36:28.180
 And many have edited it, many have collected it over a long period of time. 

01:36:28.420   01:36:30.740
 And we have very few documents like this. 

01:36:30.740   01:36:42.620
 Just because such a document exists, it's a good reason to try to understand what the document is about to say. 

01:36:42.960   01:36:47.540
 And, I have already said, this is the world's first Hyperlinked Document .. 

01:36:47.540   01:36:50.180
 and it is very worth long-term thinking. 

01:36:51.900   01:36:57.320
 Alright. There are 4 sources in the Old Testament, or the Jewish Bible. 

01:36:57.920   01:36:59.700
 The four stories we know have merged. 

01:36:59.980   01:37:02.860
 One source is called The Priestly. 

01:37:03.080   01:37:06.440
 And they used the name Elohim or El Shaddai for God. 

01:37:06.680   01:37:10.200
 And I think El is the root word for Allah, too. 

01:37:12.160   01:37:21.080
 And this is commonly translated by God or gods, because Elohim was used in the plural at the beginnings of the Bible book. 

01:37:21.320   01:37:24.000
 And this is newer than the version of the Lord. 

01:37:24.000   01:37:30.480
 The reason I'm telling you is that Genesis 1, the first story, is not as old as Genesis 2. 

01:37:30.480   01:37:35.900
 Genesis 2 contains, the Lord's version, for example, contains the story of Adam and Eve. 

01:37:36.280   01:37:38.760
 And this story is older than the first book in the Bible. 

01:37:39.160   01:37:41.880
 But they decided to put a newer version of the first one. 

01:37:42.240   01:37:47.340
 And I think that's because it is more about basic abstractions. 

01:37:47.380   01:37:55.900
 For example, it deals with the most basic abstraction, how the universe is created, and then continues in the story of what man's environment is. 

01:37:56.440   01:37:58.380
 That seems to be the logic behind it. 

01:38:00.380   01:38:08.400
 the version of the Lord is used by the name YHWH, which seems that people did not say, but we believe we would say something like "Yahweh" 

01:38:09.480   01:38:14.860
 And that is an antromorphic God, that is, one who takes on the human form. 

01:38:15.160   01:38:17.000
 It begins with Post 2: 4. 

01:38:17.200   01:38:27.080
 Here we come to the concept of the earthly paradise, the stories of Adam and Eve, Cain and Ablo, the Noah, the Babylonian Cage, the Book of Exodus and the Numbers, together with the Priestly version. 

01:38:27.300   01:38:35.340
 It also contains the form of the Ten Commandments of God, which is in fact the basic form of law. 

01:38:38.340   01:38:42.820
 The sources of the Elohists contain stories about Abraham and Isaac. 

01:38:43.300   01:38:46.640
 This version deals with the hierarchy of heaven that includes angels. 

01:38:46.640   01:38:48.620
 Talking about leaving Egypt 

01:38:48.920   01:38:55.340
 represents the Ark of the Alliance, which is the idea that the society was founded (this was a Jesuit society) 

01:38:55.340   01:39:01.180
 based on the Alliance with God, which is exposed in a series of rules, one of which is the Ten Commandments of God. 

01:39:01.180   01:39:04.080
 but many of these rules are much wider. 

01:39:04.600   01:39:12.200
 And finally with Deuteronomists, it contains the Book of the Law and the Deuteronomic History .. 

01:39:12.200   01:39:16.260
 And it is independent of the Book of Genesis, Exodus, Levitical Law, and the Book of Numbers. 

01:39:16.480   01:39:24.620
 And so we know this, we can now debate this as well as everything, I pass through various branches of education 

01:39:24.620   01:39:34.620
 But people generally assume that there were many authors over a long period of time, and the way they came to this text analysis, you know? 

01:39:34.740   01:39:40.920
 trying to see the links between the story, whether they have the same style, are the parts of the story the same? 

01:39:40.920   01:39:46.320
 And people are trying to kill you, because you know, it's obvious that it's hard to examine something so old. 

01:39:46.420   01:39:48.920
 But that's the basic idea. 

01:39:49.120   01:39:53.780
 So there are more views on these original items. 

01:39:53.780   01:39:55.380
 And it's important to know. 

01:39:55.600   01:39:58.780
 It's something like a collective story. 

01:40:01.880   01:40:05.320
 All right, now, to understand the first part of the Genesis Book, 

01:40:06.260   01:40:07.380
 I will turn, 

01:40:09.460   01:40:11.880
 which is pretty strange, 

01:40:13.820   01:40:19.060
 something that is actually part of the New Testament, and this is actually the central thought of Christianity 

01:40:19.660   01:40:24.060
 And that is a very strange idea, and it will take a long time to clear it. 

01:40:24.060   01:40:29.980
 But the idea, this John told of Christ, said, "In the beginning was the Word." 

01:40:30.040   01:40:36.840
 This refers back to Genesis1 "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was of God, and the Word was God." 

01:40:37.460   01:40:45.620
 That's something, so three sentences like these need to get rid of a lot, because nothing makes sense, right? 

01:40:45.620   01:40:50.080
 In the beginning, the Word was. And the Word was from God. And the Word was God. 

01:40:50.840   01:40:53.840
 So the first question is, what does that mean at all? 

01:40:54.300   01:40:57.320
 Initially there was the Word, that is Logos, in fact. 

01:40:58.220   01:41:04.320
 And the Logos is embodied in the figure of Christ. So John had the idea that, whatever Christ is, he is the son of God, 

01:41:04.700   01:41:11.620
 and that it is not only set in history at a certain time and place, as a carpenter in an unknown part of the world, 

01:41:11.780   01:41:13.440
 but also something eternal 

01:41:13.760   01:41:17.580
 which is beyond the boundaries of space and time, something that has been there since the very beginning. 

01:41:18.140   01:41:22.740
 And, as far as I can tell, what Logos represents is something modern people, 

01:41:23.040   01:41:27.240
 they think when they talk about consciousness. 

01:41:27.640   01:41:35.040
 Something so, more than that. It is, as well, the awareness, and the capacity to be aware of, and the communication capacity. 

01:41:35.460   01:41:43.140
 It is more than that, and there is an idea below, and that is to say that being, especially from a phenomenological perspective, that which experience is, 

01:41:43.140   01:41:45.160
 can not exist unconscious. 

01:41:45.600   01:41:49.980
 It is as if consciousness shines light on something to bring it to existence. 

01:41:50.140   01:41:53.460
 Because unconscious, what is there? 

01:41:53.860   01:41:55.460
 Nobody can experience anything. 

01:41:56.080   01:41:59.160
 Is there anything if no one can experience anything? 

01:41:59.220   01:42:00.500
 That's a question. 

01:42:00.680   01:42:08.120
 The answer that this book gives is; no, you have to think about your consciousness as the basic element of reality. 

01:42:08.120   01:42:12.580
 This is something without which the reality itself can not exist. 

01:42:12.800   01:42:15.580
 Of course, it depends on what you mean by reality. 

01:42:16.100   01:42:23.100
 But the reality I refer to here, as I have just told you, is a weird mix of subjective experience and the world. 

01:42:23.240   01:42:30.880
 But the question is deeper than that, because it is not obvious that reality exists, if no one experiences it. 

01:42:31.000   01:42:36.760
 The whole concept of time seems to break apart, at least in terms of the feeling of time. 

01:42:36.900   01:42:42.660
 And the size question disappears if there is no one to measure it. 

01:42:43.000   01:42:44.840
 Cause seems to disappear. 

01:42:47.020   01:42:50.040
 We do not understand consciousness. Not least. 

01:42:50.540   01:42:55.660
 We do not understand what is inside us, which gives us the light of existence. 

01:42:55.660   01:43:01.880
 And what is happening in the Old Testament is that consciousness is associated with the divine. 

01:43:02.500   01:43:06.180
 Now you can think, and is this a reasonable proposition? 

01:43:07.060   01:43:12.420
 This is a very complicated question, but at least they may know that there is something in that claim. 

01:43:13.000   01:43:18.000
 because there is a miracle of experience and existence that depends on consciousness. 

01:43:18.000   01:43:22.420
 I mean, people are trying to explain it all the time, but it does not seem to work the best. 

01:43:22.420   01:43:26.580
 And that is something that is really worth considering. 

01:43:26.580   01:43:30.320
 People do not like being treated as if they are not aware of it. 

01:43:31.000   01:43:33.080
 Is it? They react very badly to it. 

01:43:33.740   01:43:36.880
 And you do not like when someone assumes you're not aware, 

01:43:36.880   01:43:40.180
 and you do not like when someone assumes you have no free will. 

01:43:40.440   01:43:46.820
 You know that your actions and actions are predetermined in advance, and that there is nothing that can fix you. 

01:43:46.820   01:43:49.420
 And you do not have to take responsibility for your work. 

01:43:49.420   01:43:56.100
 INAs culture, the laws of culture, are set to the idea that people are aware, 

01:43:56.100   01:44:02.800
 people have different experiences, decide, and are responsible for their actions if there is an element of free will in that. 

01:44:02.800   01:44:06.200
 And you can argue it philosophically, okay. 

01:44:06.200   01:44:12.300
 But the point is that it is how we behave and this is the ideal on which our legal system is set. 

01:44:12.640   01:44:18.240
 And there is something deep in that, because you are subject to the law. 

01:44:19.060   01:44:21.700
 But the law is also limited to you. 

01:44:21.960   01:44:28.040
 Which means that in a functional, properly-founded democratic system, 

01:44:28.420   01:44:31.680
 there is a value inside you. 

01:44:32.120   01:44:35.720
 It's the source of your rights, even if you're a killer. 

01:44:36.080   01:44:41.300
 We have to say that the law can only go so far, because there is something divine in you. 

01:44:41.780   01:44:43.100
 Well, what does that mean? 

01:44:43.100   01:44:49.980
 Well, in part, it means that there is something in you that is aware of and able to communicate, as if the whole world is in you. 

01:44:50.480   01:44:53.740
 And you have it to contribute to everyone, and that's worth it. 

01:44:53.740   01:45:00.740
 If you can learn new things, change the structure of society, you can invent new ways to deal with the world. 

01:45:01.020   01:45:02.380
 You're all capable of it. 

01:45:02.380   01:45:05.800
 The part that is in you, and this is related to this. 

01:45:06.840   01:45:11.240
 That's exactly the idea of ​​having something in Logos 

01:45:12.900   01:45:21.020
 which is necessary for a chaos of reality beyond the limits of experience to manifest itself as reality. 

01:45:21.540   01:45:27.540
 This is an amazing idea because consciousness plays a constitutive role in the universe. 

01:45:28.040   01:45:32.640
 And you can debate it, but it's not just that you can just dismiss it. 

01:45:33.360   01:45:40.780
 Because, above all, we are the most politicized creatures we know, and that is very much .. 

01:45:40.780   01:45:43.060
 We're so complicated that it's incredible. 

01:45:43.400   01:45:48.380
 So, you know, there is a huge universe up there, but there is also a huge universe in us. 

01:45:48.600   01:45:56.800
 And that the universe is bigger and more important is not obvious, unless you take parameters like the relative size, but, you know, this is not the most sophisticated approach. 

01:45:57.280   01:46:05.440
 And whatever you are, you have this capacity to experience reality and change it, which is a very weird thing, you know? 

01:46:05.440   01:46:08.920
 You can imagine the future, in your imagination. 

01:46:08.980   01:46:11.600
 And then you can work and manifest it. 

01:46:11.880   01:46:14.300
 You are participating in the process of creation. 

01:46:14.580   01:46:16.000
 This is one way of thinking about it 

01:46:16.520   01:46:25.240
 That is why I think in Genesis 1, the idea that both man and woman are made in the image of God. 

01:46:25.340   01:46:35.040
 which is very interesting because feminists have always criticized Christianity for being irreparable patriarchs. 

01:46:36.600   01:46:40.880
 Of course, they criticize everything alike (SMIJEH), so it's a difficult brilliant move. 

01:46:41.160   01:46:49.320
 But I think it's an absolute miracle that at the very beginning of that document, it says clearly without any reflection. 

01:46:49.320   01:46:57.580
 that this divine spark, which we associate with a word that expresses the being, is equally manifested in women and men equally. 

01:46:57.920   01:46:59.220
 That's very cool. 

01:46:59.460   01:47:03.600
 And you should think, as I said, really take it seriously. 

01:47:03.600   01:47:07.340
 Well, what you have to ask is what happens if you do not take it seriously. 

01:47:07.820   01:47:08.320
 Is it? 

01:47:09.320   01:47:12.200
 Read Dostoyev's "Crime and Punishment." 

01:47:12.620   01:47:13.660
 That's the best ... 

01:47:15.240   01:47:20.200
 the best research of this tactic that has ever been produced 

01:47:20.320   01:47:26.600
 Because in "Crime and Punishment" it happens that the main character, whose name is Raskoljnikov, 

01:47:26.600   01:47:29.700
 concludes that there are no internal values ​​in the people. 

01:47:30.040   01:47:32.140
 And as a result, he can do whatever he wants. 

01:47:32.140   01:47:34.480
 Only cowardice is what prevents it from acting. 

01:47:34.960   01:47:41.960
 Is it? Why would there be anything else if the values ​​of other people are only singularly superstitious? 

01:47:42.220   01:47:44.580
 Why then could not you do all I want, when I want to do it? 

01:47:45.100   01:47:46.800
 What is the point of a psychopath. 

01:47:47.180   01:47:52.780
 The runner's doing this, killing someone who's a terrible person, and has very good reasons to kill her. 

01:47:52.780   01:47:58.260
 he is half starved, he is a bit crazy and obsessed with this ideology.Brillant assumption .. 

01:47:58.680   01:48:08.120
 And he finds that Su Raskoljnikov was completely and completely different before and after the killing of two completely different people. 

01:48:08.300   01:48:12.820
 Because it violated the rule, a serious rule, and no return. 

01:48:13.100   01:48:23.300
 And "Crime and Punishment" is the best research I know about what happens if you take the assumption that in one man there is nothing divine. 

01:48:23.700   01:48:24.420
 Now... 

01:48:26.860   01:48:35.740
 Most people I know are deep atheists, and I understand why they are because they have not met people like Dostoyevsky. 

01:48:35.740   01:48:37.000
 At least as far as I can tell. 

01:48:37.380   01:48:40.280
 Because I do not see logical mistakes in "Crime and Punishment" 

01:48:40.280   01:48:42.280
 I think psychologically correct exactly. 

01:48:42.660   01:48:45.560
 Dostoevsky 'is incredible because of this 

01:48:45.760   01:48:48.000
 in one of his books "Vags" for example, 

01:48:48.520   01:48:53.360
 describes the political scenario, not so different from what we are today. 

01:48:53.700   01:48:58.440
 And there are people who are obsessed with rationalist, utopian, atheistic ideas. 

01:48:58.660   01:49:01.740
 they are very powerful. The communist revolution was born. 

01:49:01.840   01:49:03.620
 Is it? I mean, these are powerful ideas. 

01:49:04.040   01:49:13.620
 The character in that book, Stavrogin, also acts with the assumption that human beings have no innate nature and value. 

01:49:14.040   01:49:23.360
 And that's another brilliant study. And Dostoyevsky prophesied, I would say, what will happen to society if we go this way. 

01:49:23.360   01:49:25.620
 And he was accurate to detail. 

01:49:25.740   01:49:31.060
 It is unusual to read Dostoyevsky's books "Opsjednti" or "Devils", depending on the translation, 

01:49:31.260   01:49:34.380
 then read the book by Alexander Solzhenitsyn's "Archipelago Gulag" 

01:49:34.520   01:49:42.500
 because one is fiction and prophecy, and the other is, Hey, it turns out that the substances happened exactly as Dostoyevsky said for the same reasons 

01:49:42.560   01:49:44.040
 So it's really impressive. 

01:49:44.380   01:49:54.800
 So the question is under A: Is there anything cosmic about consciousness, 

01:49:54.840   01:49:58.540
 and under B: could this be considered a divine, 

01:49:58.660   01:50:01.780
 and under C: whether it is in every person .. 

01:50:02.120   01:50:06.540
 And then ask yourself, if you're not a criminal, 

01:50:07.260   01:50:11.160
 And then wonder, does this reflect the reality? 

01:50:11.160   01:50:16.960
 Is it a metaphor? For example, it could be a complex metaphor we have to serve to organize our societies. 

01:50:17.160   01:50:24.480
 It could be very easy, but even as a metaphor, it is true enough that if we do not adhere to it, we do it at its own expense. 

01:50:24.760   01:50:27.700
 And it took people a long time to figure it out. 

01:50:29.700   01:50:31.020
 This is Genesis 1. 

01:50:32.060   01:50:35.980
 You know what, I'll probably be here because I think it's 9:30. 

01:50:36.480   01:50:38.600
 And we did not even come to the first sentence. 

01:50:38.820   01:50:40.740
 [LAUGHTER 

01:50:40.900   01:50:47.640
 [APPLAUSE] 

01:50:47.940   01:50:51.080
 [LAUGHTER] 

01:50:51.160   01:50:51.960
 Yes Yes. 

01:50:52.500   01:50:56.860
 Listen, I want to read something that will use us as an introduction for the next time 

01:50:57.480   01:51:02.540
 I'm just going to slip through some ideas that are related to the divine idea 

01:51:02.680   01:51:06.540
 And we will return to the first sentences when we start the next lesson. 

01:51:06.540   01:51:10.000
 I do not know how far I will come with biblical stories, by the way 

01:51:10.000   01:51:10.500
 [LAUGHTER 

01:51:10.520   01:51:13.040
 Because I'm trying to blow this out as I go through it. 

01:51:13.220   01:51:20.480
 In Christianity there is an idea that the image of God is a trinity, right? 

01:51:20.500   01:51:25.600
 There is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. 

01:51:25.640   01:51:29.400
 And something like tradition, the spirit of tradition, 

01:51:29.740   01:51:35.020
 It's something like human beings are the latest incarnation of that tradition. 

01:51:35.020   01:51:37.300
 Live incarnations of this tradition. 

01:51:37.680   01:51:44.560
 And then this is something like a spirit in people who make relationships with this and that possible. 

01:51:44.720   01:51:45.920
 Individual spirit. 

01:51:45.920   01:51:53.780
 I will run through some of the classic, metaphorical attributes of God, 

01:51:53.780   01:51:57.020
 so we have some idea about what we're doing 

01:51:57.020   01:52:03.280
 when we return to Genesis 1 and talk about God who has made everything out of chaos. 

01:52:03.780   01:52:09.820
 So that's the character of the Father. So here's a description of what God is like a father. 

01:52:10.160   01:52:13.940
 You can enter into a vow with Him. You can agree with Him. 

01:52:13.940   01:52:19.400
 Money is also the same. Because money is a negotiation with the future. 

01:52:19.680   01:52:24.560
 So we have explored our world so we can negotiate with the future .. 

01:52:24.900   01:52:30.340
 And I do not think it would come to an end, that there was no such idea from which everything started. 

01:52:30.760   01:52:33.340
 You can act as if the future is real. 

01:52:33.340   01:52:38.220
 There is a spirit of tradition that allows you to work with the future with something you can negotiate. 

01:52:38.300   01:52:40.220
 That's why you are sacrificing. 

01:52:40.540   01:52:46.060
 Sacrifices have been a part of the act for a long time, and now they are psychological. 

01:52:46.180   01:52:54.160
 You know, you can sacrifice something valuable in the present and expect to negotiate with the future 

01:52:54.600   01:52:57.600
 And tp is an incredible human discovery. 

01:52:57.660   01:53:01.000
 No other being can do that, act like the future is real 

01:53:01.120   01:53:07.240
 The idea is that you can negotiate with the very real and the successful one. That's unbelievable. 

01:53:07.460   01:53:09.080
 And it really works. 

01:53:09.560   01:53:10.840
 It answers the prayers. 

01:53:11.300   01:53:13.740
 I'm not saying anything is true of this, in a word. 

01:53:13.800   01:53:17.160
 I'm just saying what the cloud of ideas represents. 

01:53:18.100   01:53:22.800
 Punish and reward. Wonder and forgive. It's not nature .. 

01:53:23.760   01:53:30.560
 One of the things weird about the Jewish-Christian tradition is that God and nature are not the same thing at all. 

01:53:30.560   01:53:35.740
 Whatever God is, spotted in the logos, is something out of all nature. 

01:53:35.740   01:53:41.300
 And I think it is something like consciousness drawn as abstraction from the natural world 

01:53:42.800   01:53:46.280
 God created Paradise Garden for people and expelled us for our disobedience. 

01:53:46.360   01:53:47.880
 It's too hard to touch him. 

01:53:48.620   01:53:50.020
 They drove us free will. 

01:53:50.020   01:53:53.560
 The distance between Him is hell. Distance from Him is death. 

01:53:53.920   01:53:57.600
 He reveals himself in dogmas and mystical experiences. 

01:53:57.760   01:53:58.860
 And He is the Law. 

01:53:59.220   01:54:01.200
 So this is a partial aspect of the Father. 

01:54:01.640   01:54:03.440
 And then the aspect of the Son. 

01:54:03.900   01:54:08.720
 He says chaos in line. He kills dragons and feeds people with his remains. 

01:54:08.720   01:54:11.000
 Finds gold, rescue virgins .. 

01:54:11.000   01:54:13.140
 It is the body and blood of Christ. 

01:54:13.140   01:54:18.720
 It is a tragic sacrifice and a sacrificial lamb and at the same time a victorious conqueror. 

01:54:18.720   01:54:20.240
 Concerns are dropped. 

01:54:20.500   01:54:21.940
 He died and was born again. 

01:54:22.460   01:54:24.900
 He is King of Kings and Hero over Heroes. 

01:54:25.180   01:54:29.760
 It is not a state, but at the same time it is also a critic and a statesman. 

01:54:30.160   01:54:32.020
 She lives in a perfect home. 

01:54:32.400   01:54:34.280
 His goal is Paradise or the Kingdom of God. 

01:54:34.440   01:54:35.960
 It can save you from hell. 

01:54:36.080   01:54:37.760
 Concerns are dropped. 

01:54:38.060   01:54:41.140
 He was the headstone that was rejected. 

01:54:41.340   01:54:43.340
 And He is the Spirit of the Law. 

01:54:45.220   01:54:47.060
 And then we have the Holy Spirit. 

01:54:47.640   01:54:49.480
 It's similar to the human soul. 

01:54:49.980   01:54:51.740
 He is the voice of the prophet. 

01:54:51.860   01:54:54.580
 He is a small voice of conscience. 

01:54:54.600   01:54:56.120
 Pronounced isitina. 

01:54:56.340   01:54:58.180
 He's playing it with music. 

01:54:59.340   01:55:02.040
 Enemy of scams, arrogance and scorn. 

01:55:02.200   01:55:03.720
 He is the water of life. 

01:55:04.000   01:55:05.600
 He gets up without being consumed. 

01:55:05.760   01:55:07.340
 And He is a glittering light. 

01:55:07.780   01:55:13.040
 All right, this is a very well-developed set of poetic metaphors, is not it? 

01:55:13.320   01:55:20.340
 So these are all the ideas of the ideal that is above all, that's the right way to think about it. 

01:55:20.340   01:55:22.820
 Ideas about the ideal that is above all. 

01:55:23.040   01:55:25.160
 And each of them has a specific meaning 

01:55:25.200   01:55:31.520
 And how do we go through lectures, we will discover these meanings. 

01:55:31.660   01:55:33.080
 So what we have now 

01:55:36.220   01:55:39.140
 is a brief description of what it is. 

01:55:39.140   01:55:42.440
 In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth. 

01:55:42.440   01:55:46.040
 We know that it was associated with Logos in the sequel to the story. 

01:55:46.160   01:55:48.780
 We know it is related to the Word and the Consciousness. 

01:55:49.080   01:55:51.560
 And we know that it is related to 

01:55:52.180   01:55:53.140
 to what God is. 

01:55:53.140   01:55:58.180
 And then I presented a metaphorical picture of that, which at least partly describes God. 

01:55:58.180   01:56:01.340
 Now we have some sense of being doing this: 

01:56:01.340   01:56:03.140
 creates heaven and earth. 

01:56:03.340   01:56:05.180
 The earth was empty and empty. 

01:56:05.180   01:56:08.640
 And that is a chaotic state of interrelated confusion. 

01:56:08.960   01:56:11.040
 the darkness spread over the bumpy. 

01:56:11.200   01:56:13.880
 and the spirit of God floated over the waters 

01:56:14.040   01:56:17.500
 And God said, "Let there be light!" And there would be light. 

01:56:17.960   01:56:19.400
 We'll stay here. 

01:56:20.060   01:56:26.180
 Because we are now ready to take the first step in this Book. 

01:56:26.360   01:56:35.820
 And it's important that you have the right conceptual framework so you can appreciate where this goes and what it means. 

01:56:35.920   01:56:43.260
 And so I did everything I could to elaborate a single word, I guess. 

01:56:43.660   01:56:45.060
 [LAUGHTER] 

01:56:45.400   01:56:47.000
 But that's a big word, you know? 

01:56:48.240   01:56:53.480
 It is not so unreasonable that it takes so long to understand what I'm trying to say to you. 

01:56:55.980   01:56:56.700
 Alright. 

01:56:57.680   01:57:01.980
 It's not even close ... I thought I would get PUNO from this. 

01:57:01.980   01:57:03.200
 [LAUGHTER] 

01:57:03.200   01:57:03.700
 Alright. 

01:57:04.160   01:57:05.180
 Thank you very much. 

01:57:05.320   01:57:25.760
 [APPLAUz] 

01:57:25.800   01:57:30.360
 We have time for a few questions. We have to go out at 10:30. 

01:57:30.360   01:57:37.180
 9:30 am, we may have questions while some fool does not take the microphone and / SMIJEH] 

01:57:37.180   01:57:40.480
 Or maybe we might have half an hour's questions, something like that. 

01:57:40.480   01:57:45.100
 If someone has questions, there is a microphone, and there is one. 

01:57:47.920   01:57:51.740
 I'm going to try the best I can. 

01:57:53.680   01:57:54.980
 Let's start. 

01:57:56.100   01:58:07.740
 All right, you've been talking about the idea of ​​dealing with something you're afraid of, going face to face and freaking out the fear. 

01:58:08.180   01:58:16.740
 But then you said that the idea when you face something, that means everything in the world, and I wonder if you can explain what that means. 

01:58:16.780   01:58:20.720
 Work ... Build your marriage on quarrels. 

01:58:21.040   01:58:21.540
 Alright. 

01:58:21.940   01:58:25.040
 You know, you're arguing with a woman, arguing with the kids. 

01:58:25.220   01:58:26.860
 That's a chaotic state. 

01:58:27.140   01:58:34.440
 Because no one has managed to shape some sort of controversy and confusion. 

01:58:34.440   01:58:39.220
 And then, through dialogue, you raise the structure that is actually the house where you both live. 

01:58:39.660   01:58:43.660
 And that's the idea, building the world out of chaos. 

01:58:43.920   01:58:51.720
 And that's scary, is not it? And why people often avoid arguing with people they like, because it's scary .. 

01:58:51.720   01:58:54.500
 Find out what this person is and find out what you are. 

01:58:54.500   01:58:56.280
 It's something like, God, who wants it? 

01:58:56.440   01:58:57.000
 Nobody. 

01:58:57.620   01:59:02.400
 And, your heart's work is accelerating and it is coping and conflict. 

01:59:02.800   01:59:09.120
 And that is because you are entering a domain that was not well-known and established. 

01:59:09.700   01:59:14.160
 And do it with your Predator Detection System, in essence. 

01:59:14.400   01:59:23.220
 So the chaos that threatens, say, marriage is equivalent, say it, a zombie to a tree, that is one form of equivalent. 

01:59:23.520   01:59:29.020
 And then, by negotiating and dialogue, you formulate this problem. 

01:59:29.020   01:59:30.640
 What is actually happening here? 

01:59:30.640   01:59:31.860
 What are we actually talking about? 

01:59:31.860   01:59:33.500
 Where exactly is the problem? 

01:59:33.820   01:59:39.580
 So, keep on talking until you make the consensus about it, some with whom you can live, some with whom you can act. 

01:59:40.080   01:59:45.220
 Is it? And maybe you can solve the problem and restore peace. 

01:59:45.220   01:59:47.940
 Peace, it's a house where you can both live. 

01:59:48.120   01:59:53.160
 And that is a chaos in which people can often get caught all the time, and often fall. 

01:59:53.280   02:00:00.300
 And chaos is what lures the marriage on the shore and turns into, for example, a 15-year breakdown process. 

02:00:00.720   02:00:01.980
 A terrible thing. 

02:00:02.280   02:00:04.180
 So, that's the idea. 

02:00:05.320   02:00:06.120
 Okay, thank you. 

02:00:06.220   02:00:06.720
 Alright. 

02:00:07.060   02:00:10.920
 [APPLAUSE] 

02:00:12.820   02:00:16.300
 Hi dr. Peterson, thank you for your speeches and thank you for your teachings. 

02:00:16.460   02:00:23.460
 She really helped me. I had a college experience, 2 English language degrees, the way you described the huanistic sciences 

02:00:23.880   02:00:27.140
 and devotionally helped me to understand those experiences then. 

02:00:27.240   02:00:27.820
 So thank you. 

02:00:28.420   02:00:34.100
 That's bad, it's bad that this is happening. Really, you know that's not good. 

02:00:34.200   02:00:35.500
 [Laughter] 

02:00:35.500   02:00:37.120
 You do not have to talk about it. 

02:00:37.280   02:00:37.780
 That. 

02:00:38.200   02:00:40.280
 But, you know what, I've survived and learned a lot 

02:00:40.280   02:00:40.780
 That. 

02:00:40.780   02:00:45.220
 And I'm not unhappy about that experience, I've learned a lot. 

02:00:45.220   02:00:51.460
 But you said something, you described the story collection from the Bible in an interesting way, and I wondered if that was intentional. 

02:00:51.700   02:01:02.340
 You have described it as a set of stories written by many people, over time, of hyperlink within themselves. 

02:01:02.660   02:01:07.820
 And it sounds very close to the description of how the internet works. 

02:01:08.420   02:01:14.960
 Well, it's not by accident, because the internet is also a collective venture 

02:01:15.260   02:01:17.920
 And God knows what personality will manifest. 

02:01:18.440   02:01:23.300
 But it will show some personality because it learns how to understand us, and that very quickly 

02:01:23.860   02:01:29.020
 So I think there is no reason to think about it as a predecessor. 

02:01:29.420   02:01:34.880
 Distance to the Bible and the Internet is much smaller than the distance between man and chimpanzee 

02:01:37.100   02:01:46.960
 And the difference between the book and the internet is also, in some sense, a matter of degree rather than a kind. 

02:01:48.500   02:01:59.760
 [Unintelligible] 

02:01:59.900   02:02:05.800
 I can not guess because God knows what will happen in the next 20 years. 

02:02:05.800   02:02:06.860
 I certainly do not know. 

02:02:07.440   02:02:11.540
 I do not know what the preconditions are for consciousness. I do not have a mild connection. 

02:02:11.540   02:02:13.420
 And I do not think nobody knows. 

02:02:13.420   02:02:15.540
 So, we'll probably find out. 

02:02:17.920   02:02:18.420
 That. 

02:02:19.300   02:02:24.060
 [APPLAUSE] 

02:02:24.240   02:02:25.560
 Hi Dr. Peterson. 

02:02:25.940   02:02:31.140
 I am interested in the link between visual beauty and religious experience. 

02:02:31.140   02:02:34.740
 You have touched it once or twice during the lecture. 

02:02:34.820   02:02:46.280
 Is it possible that something amazingly beautiful wakes up a religious or mystical experience, or something in that rank. 

02:02:46.280   02:02:47.820
 I think that's why there are beautiful things. 

02:02:47.920   02:02:52.500
 If you look at the structure of the Renaissance cathedral, 

02:02:53.060   02:03:06.200
 That's literally what I wanted. It was my argument, is that why we have a cathedral as spectacular buildings as opposed to .. 

02:03:06.300   02:03:15.440
 Yeah, I mean, if you're going to build a house for an ultimate ideal, you're building something particularly nice to show where it stands. 

02:03:15.440   02:03:16.580
 And it should be nice. 

02:03:16.580   02:03:19.360
 And that's something people do not take seriously. 

02:03:19.660   02:03:22.420
 That's something we do not take seriously in Canada. 

02:03:22.880   02:03:29.840
 I mean, look at the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in the beauty of Europe 

02:03:30.580   02:03:39.000
 I mean, a spectacular, overwhelming, invisible beauty that paid off who knew how many times the investment was made. 

02:03:39.000   02:03:45.320
 People are always walking in Europe because it's so beautiful and startling: 

02:03:45.780   02:03:48.640
 Beauty is so valuable, and we are so scared. 

02:03:49.040   02:03:56.040
 and I think we are afraid of beauty because it is a signpost, and not the only one, milsim there are signs to the divine 

02:03:56.400   02:03:58.400
 Love is one of them, I suppose .. 

02:03:58.400   02:04:03.220
 But beauty, especially for people who have affinity with her, it's like music. 

02:04:03.220   02:04:05.880
 It's one of those things that can not be argued, right? 

02:04:06.220   02:04:08.560
 You can not even understand, you just guess. 

02:04:09.180   02:04:14.480
 And show you the ideal, that's one way of thinking about it .. 

02:04:14.480   02:04:19.260
 but you also show, at least, as a kind of vision of the future .. 

02:04:19.260   02:04:20.640
 Something similar to that too. 

02:04:20.640   02:04:25.860
 If only merged and beautified things, it would be a place where everyone could live. 

02:04:25.860   02:04:31.840
 and that would have refined us, and that is why Jerusalem is paved with precious stones, you know? 

02:04:31.840   02:04:37.820
 They shine, shine light, it is the right place to enlighten the consciousness to live. 

02:04:37.820   02:04:41.060
 Beauty is the right place where enlightened consciousness can live. 

02:04:41.180   02:04:45.980
 And we ignore our spiritual and economic harm. 

02:04:46.000   02:04:51.200
 Obviously beauty, there is almost nothing worth the beauty. 

02:04:51.880   02:04:53.260
 Economically, practically, is not it? 

02:04:53.420   02:04:54.580
 That. 

02:04:55.520   02:04:59.920
 Why is that so, who knows? 

02:05:00.860   02:05:01.500
 You know? 

02:05:01.940   02:05:06.840
 It is a very mysterious reason why we consider the fine stones to be nice. 

02:05:07.320   02:05:08.540
 There are deep reasons for this. 

02:05:11.380   02:05:16.260
 [APPLAUZ] 

02:05:16.260   02:05:16.760
 Hi. 

02:05:17.240   02:05:19.180
 In fact, I have a similar question 

02:05:19.200   02:05:28.660
 I know that one of the ways in which the Bible is respected, even of some of the strictest critics and deep atheists 

02:05:28.800   02:05:36.160
 as a work of literature, at least the translation of King James, and as something very aesthetically beautiful, 

02:05:36.160   02:05:39.400
 And as a great work of literature and a great work of poetry. 

02:05:39.540   02:05:53.700
 And I wonder, from your study and your personal perspective, whether there are any passages or parts that are particularly impressive to you if you can divide it. 

02:05:53.860   02:05:59.780
 Well, the parts that really opened up to me, at least, I mean, are stories from Genesis. 

02:06:00.360   02:06:08.500
 All the way to the Babylonian Tomb, because I think, and I hope to talk about it, I think I've gained a sense of what these parts mean and why. 

02:06:08.720   02:06:11.600
 I know it's not exhaustive, obviously, but 

02:06:12.280   02:06:14.460
 stories from the Exit too. 

02:06:14.460   02:06:17.160
 I have the feeling that I have managed to perceive. 

02:06:17.460   02:06:20.420
 And those stories hit me like a train. 

02:06:20.520   02:06:27.460
 And just trying to understand this first part of Genesis, trying to understand what those concepts meant to be .. 

02:06:27.740   02:06:36.940
 Especially when I began to realize that people were made in the image of God, that God has all these attributes that we have enumerated 

02:06:37.300   02:06:44.300
 that people are made to the image of God, and that this is actually the cornerstone of our legal system, that really shaken me. 

02:06:44.300   02:06:54.300
 Because I did not understand it well enough, our law bodies have this metaphysical assumption without which the law would break. 

02:06:54.300   02:06:56.100
 And it is starting to happen, really .. 

02:06:56.100   02:06:58.380
 You know, that's postmodern criticism of the law. 

02:06:58.480   02:07:09.280
 The study of rights, I would say, is overwhelmed by post-modernists who undermine the structure of the Western Laws as quickly as they can; because they do not accept anything from this. 

02:07:09.420   02:07:18.980
 They consider the law as some kind of auxiliary tool that can be manipulated to make some utopia come out of it. 

02:07:19.180   02:07:22.140
 It's a real, really bad idea. 

02:07:22.760   02:07:29.120
 It is therefore very strange (for me) to get off the track as soon as the metaphysical foundation is shaken. 

02:07:29.240   02:07:36.640
 Do you think you appreciate beauty because it hides some truth. 

02:07:36.680   02:07:53.380
 I mean this because even atheistic critics like Dawkins or Hitchens appreciate the Bible as a part of really beautiful literature and as a well-written work even if they reject the theses they offer. 

02:07:53.560   02:08:07.840
 Well, I think that something can not be seen as beautiful and poetic, and reject the thesis, because if you see it as beautiful and poetic, you automatically envision the thesis with your vision of a beautiful and poetic, 

02:08:07.840   02:08:11.640
 Though you might be fighting this with your articulated rationality. 

02:08:11.900   02:08:16.920
 So this points to a disaggregated perspective on the book. 

02:08:17.100   02:08:26.620
 And it is not surprising that this is so, everyone has such a look at the book, except that in their case is a little more developed and well thought out. 

02:08:27.040   02:08:29.080
 But I think it's essentially ... 

02:08:29.500   02:08:33.760
 They do not access the Book with enough respect, that's my feeling 

02:08:34.120   02:08:36.780
 And who knows, right? I do not know. 

02:08:36.780   02:08:41.120
 But what I was trying to do is to think that there is more to it than I know 

02:08:41.920   02:08:50.300
 And I tried to figure it out of that perspective, rather than think, so it is a set of superstitions that we somehow transformed. 

02:08:50.380   02:08:55.300
 Sorry, but no, that's not enough depth analysis. 

02:08:55.820   02:09:06.340
 Because there is some truth in this, but they do not take into account that the proposals from the Book are still the foundation of our culture. 

02:09:06.560   02:09:13.140
 Nietsche does not address the central thought, which is that if we write the concept of God, the whole structure breaks down. 

02:09:13.780   02:09:21.500
 You can argue it, okay. but I'd like you to read Nietschze and try to argue with him because he's a pretty tough nut on that question. 

02:09:22.020   02:09:29.460
 I think the atheists did not fight the real problem. 

02:09:30.860   02:09:31.360
 That. 

02:09:32.800   02:09:38.100
 [APPLAUSE] 

02:09:38.100   02:09:44.220
 So I appreciate the laying down of some of the rules that would keep things rational, and I think that can help. 

02:09:44.360   02:09:54.640
 What I'm asking ... For example, in the New Testament, from what we can see, psychology is correct. 

02:09:54.780   02:10:02.140
 And that's pretty amazing, I'd say. There are many things in your explanation of these stories, in other places. 

02:10:02.280   02:10:06.280
 You pointed out the deep truths, really powerful. 

02:10:06.640   02:10:21.020
 Whatever my question was, Nietschze had to be very intelligent and profound to predict things in the next century, 

02:10:21.260   02:10:27.660
 rationally, if the Bible is not infallible the Word of God, what is happening? 

02:10:28.160   02:10:29.760
 That's a good question. 

02:10:29.760   02:10:34.160
 That is a very good question, and I will try to answer rationally. 

02:10:34.380   02:10:44.620
 But, as I said, this is something I've been thinking for a long time, 

02:10:44.620   02:10:50.520
 and that is not sure if I am a representative of the religious glimpse of the world, or her worst critic. 

02:10:50.920   02:10:55.720
 Because I try to rationalize things, and there is an element of deprivation. 

02:10:55.720   02:11:00.920
 But I think I'm doing it in a way to keep the door open for things I do not understand. 

02:11:00.920   02:11:06.040
 Because there is more about this story than I understand or understand. 

02:11:06.060   02:11:14.440
 That's why I'm trying to outline what I understand and do it rationally, but I do not believe it all that is. 

02:11:14.480   02:11:21.480
 It is a matter of interpretation of these stories that work in the world we live in today. 

02:11:21.940   02:11:24.640
 but it faces many things we do not understand. 

02:11:24.640   02:11:29.920
 One thing I learned by digging through these stories is, the deeper you dig, you'll find more. 

02:11:29.920   02:11:35.200
 And that is one of the things that convinced me that there is more in them than I thought at first. 

02:11:35.200   02:11:39.760
 Because, things would click me, and I would think, yours, that's really something. 

02:11:39.760   02:11:46.220
 and then he would separate and think, oh, so I thought he was something, but this is even more significant 

02:11:46.220   02:11:48.080
 It just opens and opens. 

02:11:48.100   02:11:58.720
 So, I'll rationalize. I'll try to answer you, and I think you're right when you said that Nietsche had the capacity for prophecy, and Dostoyevsky is in the same category. 

02:11:59.020   02:12:06.020
 It seems to be a reflection of the Transylvanian elements in the Old and New Testament that extend over long, long periods of time. 

02:12:06.380   02:12:09.400
 And I will try to get a rational approach to that. 

02:12:09.560   02:12:19.940
 But I mean, one of the reasons why the New Testament is "psychologically correct," say that, because ... And this is one of the things deeply embedded in the structure of the Bible. 

02:12:20.020   02:12:28.660
 In the Old Testament, there is this idea that, through the progress of states, 

02:12:28.760   02:12:33.880
 people who behave correctly will ultimately find the right country. 

02:12:33.920   02:12:38.480
 And so, the state, in one way, is viewed as the entity of salvation. 

02:12:39.200   02:12:44.140
 But in the New Testament this idea is, we can say, deconstructed. 

02:12:44.480   02:12:52.080
 And instead, the state in which we live the place of redemption, the state becomes a test of redemption. 

02:12:52.220   02:13:01.720
 And so the idea that people will be redeemed will move from the utopian state to the responsibility of the individual. 

02:13:01.920   02:13:03.420
 And I think that's right. 

02:13:03.500   02:13:11.840
 I believe this is the right answer, and I think the West has been established on that idea. 

02:13:11.840   02:13:15.560
 Because the state should serve the individual. 

02:13:15.780   02:13:25.400
 I mean, that is a constant dialogue, but in the last analysis of the crown of creativity is an idividual, not a state. 

02:13:25.500   02:13:32.620
 And I believe it's so true that if we do not act so and we do not believe it, we all die painfully. 

02:13:32.620   02:13:34.300
 And that's true enough for me. 

02:13:34.520   02:13:35.020
 Therefore. 

02:13:35.980   02:13:41.260
 [APPLAUSE] 

02:13:41.340   02:13:43.540
 thank you for the enlightened conversation. 

02:13:43.860   02:13:52.160
 I'll keep you in the story of Genius, if you do not mind, because we know the book was edited, and there was the purpose of editing it. 

02:13:52.300   02:14:05.180
 Can you express your thoughts about the differences in the creation stories especially those related to man, from the first chapter, which is very like God, you know the word? 

02:14:05.260   02:14:10.360
 And others that are more like a fatherly type of creation. 

02:14:10.380   02:14:16.660
 Is this a marketing trick? What was the reason for the type of editing in a way that these two stories were linked in a certain order? 

02:14:16.740   02:14:34.140
 Well, I think the cynical critics of the Bible and religious traditions, such as the Marxists and the Freudians, say that the Bible is a manifestation of power and politics. 

02:14:34.680   02:14:39.500
 And that is political and economic motivation behind the construction of the story. 

02:14:39.500   02:14:41.960
 And I think there is little truth. 

02:14:42.220   02:14:49.600
 But I do not think it's true enough so you can take that interpretation and say: That's it. 

02:14:50.100   02:14:58.740
 And I would say that to some extent the economic and political situation has determined the way the stories will be merged together, 

02:14:58.840   02:15:10.240
 they are in one way corrected even at a detailed level, say there are political intrigues related to the emergence of Israel, 

02:15:11.220   02:15:15.900
 but when you move away from it, you see there are things that are universal and much wider. 

02:15:16.000   02:15:19.680
 And how did this happen, I do not know .. 

02:15:19.860   02:15:26.560
 I think it is safe to say that the people who made these stories have done two things. 

02:15:26.560   02:15:30.980
 I think they were guided by their aesthetic taste and conscience. 

02:15:30.980   02:15:32.420
 I honestly believe it. 

02:15:32.420   02:15:38.900
 And the reason I believe this is because I think there was any kind of propaganda, the stories would have long been forgotten. 

02:15:39.580   02:15:41.380
 Because you can not remember propaganda. 

02:15:41.740   02:15:45.580
 No one likes it, and propaganda is dead 10 or 20 years after writing. 

02:15:45.580   02:15:51.620
 And not only were these Books made and written, they were also preserved and memorized. 

02:15:51.620   02:15:55.340
 And for me it means that there is something that is related to the memory structure. 

02:15:55.340   02:16:01.000
 Think, think a bit. How does the story last for 10,000 years, unless it's a story you can remember? 

02:16:01.000   02:16:03.940
 Can not because you forget what's forgettable .. 

02:16:03.940   02:16:06.100
 And all you remember are memorable things. 

02:16:06.320   02:16:15.780
 So there is an inter-relationship between the Book itself and its public that forms the document. 

02:16:17.880   02:16:21.180
 Now, I do not know how much I answered your question in detail. 

02:16:22.700   02:16:30.800
 We'll have a lot of stories to go along, and I think we're going to clarify that interrelation. 

02:16:30.800   02:16:32.480
 And we'll start next week. 

02:16:35.340   02:16:38.720
 [APPLAUSE] 

02:16:38.860   02:16:48.000
 All right. Umm. you've really been tempted by many things you've talked about dreams, because they can lucidly dream for a few years. 

02:16:48.000   02:16:52.400
 But always in some atheistic way, almost like playing a game or something. 

02:16:52.660   02:17:05.760
 But ever since I followed your lectures, I was thinking of it from a different perspective, as if to deal with something deeper, not so. 

02:17:05.820   02:17:07.820
 maybe mythological, or maybe something like God .. 

02:17:08.020   02:17:23.080
 And what I am thinking of, I wonder what your opinion is about, and in one way, when you dream lucidly, you go beyond the limitations of an average dreamer 

02:17:23.120   02:17:27.580
 which might not be the purpose of people, right? 

02:17:27.580   02:17:33.080
 because as a person, they should be limited in one way, unlike God, which is not limited. 

02:17:33.200   02:17:41.340
 On the other hand, it is a good opportunity to have some control over your interactions with this very interesting thing. 

02:17:41.460   02:17:48.780
 So in one way, you can control your interactions, and on the other hand, you actually control them. 

02:17:48.780   02:17:55.440
 So I wonder what you think about it, and in general what do you think about lucid dreaming, should that be done? 

02:17:55.440   02:17:57.840
 I had a client who could really dream of lucid, you know? 

02:17:58.380   02:18:04.080
 And one of the things, he used these dreams to solve the problem, though he did not always pay attention to the answers. 

02:18:04.300   02:18:05.340
 sometimes yes. 

02:18:06.740   02:18:14.040
 In one of her dreams, one of the characters said she had to learn to live with slaughterhouses. 

02:18:14.480   02:18:20.120
 She was very scared of life in general, and one of the consequences was that we went to the therapy to look at the acclimatization of the deceased to solve that fear. 

02:18:20.820   02:18:26.840
 But one of the things she did, she would ask the characters in dreams they want, you know? 

02:18:26.880   02:18:29.740
 she, instead of controlling, asked questions. 

02:18:30.400   02:18:34.160
 And that's all I know about lucid dreaming. 

02:18:34.160   02:18:41.040
 I know this is a well-documented phenomenon, and women seem to be better off in research. 

02:18:41.320   02:18:45.920
 But I think what we still do not know about lucid dreaming, could fill a really thick book. 

02:18:46.420   02:18:55.380
 I think there is a danger of controlling those dreams, because you lose spontaneous revelation, though not completely, because you can not control it completely. 

02:18:57.040   02:19:01.840
 You could be an interesting book by Carla Jun about active imagination. 

02:19:02.140   02:19:04.840
 Because he had in one way learned to dream while awake. 

02:19:05.480   02:19:11.960
 And he spent a lot of time in the imagination world while he was awake, red books, 

02:19:11.980   02:19:16.740
 The red book is a document about his experiences as he dreamed of awakening. 

02:19:16.740   02:19:23.600
 But he was very interactive with these dreams, you know, instead of hiding them by his will, 

02:19:23.600   02:19:28.060
 he would have explored the dream, similar to the way you are exploring the video game. 

02:19:28.760   02:19:31.580
 Which form of sleep is in itself. 

02:19:32.800   02:19:36.720
 Yes, I would, do it for research purposes in thought. 

02:19:36.720   02:19:41.500
 You can always ask yourself what you can learn, which is really a very dangerous question when you ask for a dream 

02:19:41.500   02:19:44.160
 Because you will know what you really need to learn. 

02:19:44.180   02:19:45.540
 And that is not so pleasant. 

02:19:45.540   02:19:47.280
 but it's really worth it .. 

02:19:49.500   02:19:53.220
 [APPLAUSE] 

02:19:53.300   02:20:03.480
 In my heart, I think I can only answer only four questions, because my brain is exhausted, and I do not want to say any stupidity 

02:20:05.100   02:20:06.780
 Yes, thank you for the conversation. 

02:20:06.920   02:20:18.500
 So at the beginning of the lecture, you said that society needs this structure that is like religion-based religion, so that it would not forcefully wander between the extreme right and left, and we actually have this base. 

02:20:18.520   02:20:27.960
 And then you mentioned Nietsczhe, and how to admire how he understood these ideologies and how these dogmatic needs lay their foundation in Christianity. 

02:20:28.060   02:20:39.340
 I wonder what your thoughts are about how to have this religious base, without these dangerous ideologies coming out every bit. 

02:20:39.340   02:20:40.880
 That's what I'm trying to figure out. 

02:20:41.840   02:20:45.400
 No, really. That's really the answer to that question. 

02:20:45.740   02:20:53.600
 You know, the reason I admire Nietsczhe, because he was the ghost of all time, is a good way of thinking about it. 

02:20:53.840   02:20:55.740
 It's not like Nietschze killed God. 

02:20:56.160   02:21:02.200
 He in one way gathered what was in the air, and articulated it, did not he? 

02:21:02.240   02:21:06.380
 Incredibly deep, and dropped his finger in the eye. 

02:21:06.580   02:21:09.660
 And doing this, he announced the problem. 

02:21:10.240   02:21:16.480
 And when you release the problem, then you may be able to solve it, because you can not solve the problem if you do not know what it is. 

02:21:16.500   02:21:24.580
 The fact of making it so clear is terrible, but at least we know where we stand. 

02:21:25.080   02:21:38.080
 And, by then, I would say to Junga, all that came out of it is a deeper study of mythology and its meaning. 

02:21:38.080   02:21:43.780
 We are trying to address Nietsczhe's question and try to solve the problem. 

02:21:43.780   02:21:48.120
 The problem is something like the unification of the spirit of mankind, something like that. 

02:21:50.660   02:21:57.400
 We're lapping through that, man, and that's why you're all here, at least partly, to see how far we can do it. 

02:21:57.480   02:22:03.800
 At this pace, we'll probably get to the 12th (SMIJEH) whale, but that's the goal, you know? 

02:22:04.240   02:22:04.740
 Alright? 

02:22:05.260   02:22:10.020
 [APPLAUSE] 

02:22:15.340   02:22:21.480
 Yes, it will be available on the video. they can also make them as slides. 

02:22:25.400   02:22:29.200
 Well, that's fine. I'll be back on this when we go again. 

02:22:29.560   02:22:30.060
 Therefore. 

02:22:36.220   02:22:44.440
 Different colors represent the distance between the inter-references. 

02:22:51.360   02:22:55.360
 Well, we'll talk about it the next time. 

02:22:55.360   02:23:00.480
 Milsim, I think it's the best answer that we'll talk about next time. 

02:23:00.480   02:23:00.980
 [LAUGHTER] 

02:23:01.020   02:23:04.580
 I think of them as overlapping metaphorical domains. 

02:23:05.160   02:23:11.220
 You know, in the description I set as an aspect of Oc, the aspect of the Son and the aspect of the Holy Spirit, you can quite get out of it 

02:23:11.440   02:23:12.880
 You know, it's quite arbitrary, 

02:23:12.960   02:23:25.800
 but I think the term Trinity is an attempt to claim the idea that God is the same thing in essence, but that there is more in it. 

02:23:25.800   02:23:27.640
 There is a spirit of tradition. 

02:23:27.960   02:23:34.640
 There is as a living individual, in time and space, and then there exists as a spirit. 

02:23:35.040   02:23:39.080
 And that is the consciousness we all share. 

02:23:39.380   02:23:50.780
 About whom, you know, Jung thought as the capacity of a person to understand the tragedy and redemption of Christ in their own lives. 

02:23:51.100   02:24:02.900
 And that is something like your capacity to willingly accept the tragic conditions of your existence, and in spite of that, you are going forward to something that comes to Ray. 

02:24:02.900   02:24:05.140
 You know, as something that is united within you .. 

02:24:05.480   02:24:09.020
 And I think it's related to the idea of ​​the Trinity. 

02:24:09.160   02:24:15.880
 That's the closest thing I can do to such a short time. 

02:24:16.900   02:24:17.400
 That. 

02:24:17.520   02:24:22.600
 [APPLAUSE] 

02:24:34.940   02:24:41.000
 I think this is because of the holes that exist between what we can articulate and what we do not know. 

02:24:41.000   02:24:42.840
 Something has to fill that hole. 

02:24:43.200   02:24:48.700
 I think the law could fill this hole when it was complete, but it was not. 

02:24:49.160   02:24:59.880
 It is limited and inaccurate, and it has to rely on something that is consuming you, something like a mediator between what we know and what we do not understand yet. 

02:24:59.880   02:25:03.100
 It's a pout custom. This is something like expectation. 

02:25:03.460   02:25:06.060
 It's something like an inner sense of justice. 

02:25:06.300   02:25:08.440
 You know, I'm the law of purpose. 

02:25:08.680   02:25:11.160
 But he is not complete. 

02:25:11.160   02:25:13.320
 But without a law, there would be no grounding. 

02:25:13.340   02:25:17.840
 Just like without a body, the law would be like a word. . 

02:25:18.440   02:25:28.880
 But if you do not know what word means, using the words helps but can not help if you feel angry, the river can not tell you what anger means. 

02:25:28.980   02:25:30.760
 He will only point you to other words. 

02:25:31.080   02:25:33.520
 But the same words point to something else. 

02:25:33.780   02:25:36.260
 And the rush is about something else. 

02:25:36.440   02:25:41.260
 And without that, it must be in keeping with this something else. 

02:25:41.720   02:25:50.680
 And that is why I do not think we can ever identify with the bodies of the law, and that is why ideological utopias, 

02:25:50.680   02:25:54.540
 you see, ideological utopias reject the notion of something that is above all. 

02:25:55.180   02:25:58.080
 They say "That's what we have to do" 

02:25:58.080   02:26:05.080
 Sorry, but no, you do not know. That's not good. You should leave space for something you know, or you do not even know. 

02:26:05.340   02:26:15.520
 And in the story of the Temple of Babylon, human beings are doing this massive building that should go up to the heavens and thus occupy the place of God. 

02:26:15.920   02:26:24.220
 Well, that is the earliest warning we have about the danger of what happens when things are replaced by God. 

02:26:24.580   02:26:28.960
 And God smelled it, and fell down among men, and mixed their tongues, and scattered them. 

02:26:28.960   02:26:37.800
 Well, that's something you get when you try to make a totality of something, that it starts to break inside and disintegrate into a catastrophe. 

02:26:38.100   02:26:45.540
 so we have to keep this articulated space within the dream within the tradition, something like that. 

02:26:45.580   02:26:46.780
 Because otherwise it will not work .. 

02:26:47.200   02:26:50.780
 And I think it's the same as respect for the fact that we have bodies. 

02:26:51.160   02:26:54.240
 You know, we're not just abstract creatures that follow the rules .. 

02:26:54.540   02:26:55.840
 We did not. 

02:26:56.060   02:26:58.040
 Let's just follow some rules. 

02:26:58.580   02:27:01.920
 We do not want to follow another, and our societies are falling apart. 

02:27:02.320   02:27:10.460
 So, we do not know enough to articulate entire rules patterns, at all. 

02:27:10.680   02:27:12.260
 We can not do that at all .. 

02:27:14.440   02:27:20.140
 [APPLAUSE] 

02:27:20.200   02:27:22.340
 Hi, thanks for the conversation. 

02:27:22.500   02:27:35.860
 My question is also about dreams. You have been telling about dreams as a depiction of truth, universal truths that can be devoured in myths and religions. 

02:27:36.060   02:27:53.900
 And, as you say, it is very good for the individual, and it also seems to be a whole society because a modern individual / society can easily remember dreams or interpret them. 

02:27:53.980   02:27:59.700
 And it has also been sent to the whole society for their welfare. 

02:28:00.120   02:28:16.280
 Well, my question is what is an evolutionary contribution to society, do you think dreams point to the evolution of a group, 

02:28:16.280   02:28:22.400
 in a way that groups that did not have dreams that were converted into myths did not survive? 

02:28:22.420   02:28:30.300
 All right, I will not answer the other part of the question because it would take me far away from what I can now. 

02:28:30.300   02:28:31.880
 But I can answer the first question. 

02:28:32.400   02:28:39.120
 When you dream, in your brain, let's say this, never a switch that prevents you from moving. 

02:28:39.340   02:28:46.660
 Is it? It excludes all but your eyes, because if you turn your eyes up, you will not run around letting a lion eat. 

02:28:46.720   02:28:48.080
 It's okay to move your eyes. 

02:28:48.080   02:28:50.440
 But your body is immobile. 

02:28:50.440   02:28:52.440
 And then you can pass these simulations. 

02:28:52.980   02:29:00.820
 And, as it happens at night, this is already well-established scientifically, we know that dreams are updating memory and helping to make memories. 

02:29:00.860   02:29:02.160
 They also help you to forget something. 

02:29:02.780   02:29:11.500
 But it looks like what's happening at night, is to pass the various underlying structures of your cognitive abilities in various simulations. 

02:29:12.000   02:29:17.440
 And without danger, because you're paralyzed. Do not run around the world, exploring. 

02:29:17.480   02:29:24.120
 So that's part of how your brain is experimenting with how the world can be displayed. 

02:29:24.760   02:29:28.000
 And that seems to be absolutely necessary. 

02:29:28.060   02:29:33.180
 I mean, if you deny the man his REM dream, he will not stay psychologically long. 

02:29:33.380   02:29:40.640
 There is something in dreams needed to maintain a psychological balance. 

02:29:41.080   02:29:45.760
 So doing a kind of organization at night will advert you into that chaos. 

02:29:46.080   02:29:51.420
 In part, it seems that your category of things has limits, right? 

02:29:51.420   02:29:54.080
 But sometimes these categories are not accurate. 

02:29:54.620   02:29:59.940
 So some boundaries need to be loose, some things have to fall into some category, and some things need to be rejected. 

02:30:00.300   02:30:04.780
 And in the dream, the structure of the category is loose, and dreams are so interesting. 

02:30:05.300   02:30:06.840
 But they experiment. 

02:30:06.840   02:30:12.260
 Your mind experiments with underlying structures of imagination. 

02:30:12.480   02:30:16.760
 And trying to update your form of existence in this world. 

02:30:16.760   02:30:20.280
 Dreams often concentrate on things that cause anxiety. 

02:30:20.280   02:30:24.740
 So, if you awaken people during sleep, the most commonly reported emotion is anxiety. 

02:30:25.040   02:30:30.320
 So dream is actually the first stage of dealing with the unknown. 

02:30:30.560   02:30:33.260
 So the dream is semi-known and semi-unknown. 

02:30:33.260   02:30:38.140
 Which is actually very strange, because you understand a little, but not really. 

02:30:38.340   02:30:41.440
 And participate well-known and unknown. 

02:30:41.740   02:30:44.620
 And the dream is like a bridge between the two, so something .. 

02:30:47.460   02:30:52.800
 [APPLAUSE] 

02:30:54.060   02:30:56.740
 Um, okay, my question is in two parts. 

02:30:56.820   02:31:00.940
 First, it is a general question, and then only the application of questions. 

02:31:00.940   02:31:07.180
 My first question is, do you think the consciousness and the existence of the being are inextricably linked? 

02:31:07.420   02:31:14.840
 And the second question, when there would be something like a super computer that could theoretically have the perfect brain of the man in it, 

02:31:14.960   02:31:19.680
 Does that thing then become the same person as the person who was before. 

02:31:19.680   02:31:23.080
 So whether the being can move from one body to another, but not the consciousness? 

02:31:23.160   02:31:31.100
 Okay, the first question I would say, these stories (the Bible) are preoccupied with consciousness. 

02:31:31.100   02:31:37.140
 And giving, whether creatures as such dependent on consciousness, actually depend on how you define the being. 

02:31:37.680   02:31:43.980
 so it's always frightened when you ask, here's a sense of meaning. 

02:31:43.980   02:31:47.160
 It's frightened because it depends on how you define these two. 

02:31:47.320   02:31:55.420
 But for the purpose of the being we talk about, which are presented in these stories, is deeply associated with conscious experiences. 

02:31:55.820   02:32:05.780
 And consciousness has this basic role, the experiences we are talking about, there would be no consciousness to exist. 

02:32:06.180   02:32:12.280
 So you can think of it as a game in one way, and then you have to decide if it's a game that can be generalized. 

02:32:12.280   02:32:15.720
 And I would not answer the second question, okay? If you do not get angry. 

02:32:15.820   02:32:16.320
 [LAUGHTER 

02:32:16.320   02:32:16.820
 Alright. 

02:32:16.820   02:32:21.020
 [APPLAUSE] 

02:32:21.120   02:32:29.720
 So the question in two parts. First, very fast. if we want to read the biblical stories in the way you mentioned it as an old version, edition, source, publisher .. 

02:32:29.720   02:32:35.920
 Oh, I'll get what I like next week, I think Reader's Digest (American Literary Critic) has published amongst everything else .. 

02:32:36.320   02:32:43.680
 Shows stories in a different format. It's easier, I think it's much easier to read. 

02:32:43.680   02:32:46.360
 I can bring you the next time and show you .. 

02:32:46.740   02:32:55.680
 my second question, and the reason why I am so busy with your work, and I mean to others that you are talking rationally, but you open the door a lot more of a meaning. 

02:32:55.720   02:33:01.960
 In your interview with Transliminal Media, you mentioned a journalist's serpent, a tree ... 

02:33:02.080   02:33:02.840
 Yes Yes. 

02:33:02.900   02:33:09.980
 And you mentioned that we are kind of very good in recognizing the camouflage of the snakes, especially in the lower part of our field of vision. 

02:33:09.980   02:33:15.000
 You have further mentioned that good vision is associated with it, and that it has evolved together. 

02:33:15.000   02:33:20.140
 And you shortened the story, saying the following, I paraphrase "What gives us good vision? Snake" 

02:33:20.140   02:33:23.820
 "That's what he says in Genesis, what still gives us a good look?" "It is also true." 

02:33:23.820   02:33:28.540
 "That's why we have a vision that recognizes colors, what can a man make aware of himself, a woman, that's Eve." 

02:33:28.540   02:33:34.320
 So, I understand the basic part of some of the concepts you have about your views, dreams, abstractions, 

02:33:34.320   02:33:38.800
 But for me it raises the question, and I do not accuse you of creationism or rationalism. 

02:33:38.880   02:33:39.380
 That. 

02:33:39.380   02:33:45.940
 What is your point? why did you make that connection? What is the significance of the story of Genius? 

02:33:46.100   02:33:53.720
 No problem. As soon as we go through the first question, we will hit the second [SMIJEH] 

02:33:53.840   02:33:55.780
 [APPLAUSE] 

02:33:57.660   02:33:58.920
 Well, partly 

02:34:06.360   02:34:08.800
 Yes, I suggest that the second question shaded first. 

02:34:09.100   02:34:10.980
 And I think they're the same thing. 

02:34:10.980   02:34:16.880
 I mean Liz plays in his books with these ideas, metaphorically, but he never takes it seriously, which is not a problem. 

02:34:16.880   02:34:20.620
 I mean, there are only a few things you can take seriously, and she did a good job in that .. 

02:34:20.940   02:34:24.600
 But I'll talk a lot about it. This is a very complicated problem .. 

02:34:24.900   02:34:35.300
 I mean, for the beginning, I would say that the systems we use to deal with certain uncertainties in life, the same systems that our ancestors receive to use for detecting the snake. 

02:34:35.800   02:34:36.960
 It's a good start .. 

02:34:37.500   02:34:41.140
 Alright? Alright. One more and we're done. [APPLAUSE] 

02:34:43.260   02:34:51.720
 I'm an aeronautical space engineer and a programming expert, and I have three quick questions and I'll ask them quickly. 

02:34:51.980   02:35:02.260
 Based on your opinion, where faculties are today in the sense of humanities and social sciences, is math stronger than articulate speech? 

02:35:05.800   02:35:08.440
 I'm not quite sure how first ... 

02:35:13.220   02:35:17.680
 Well, it depends on what you feel strongly. 

02:35:17.680   02:35:23.940
 I mean, it is obvious that math and computer science studies have made people incredibly powerful. The question is: To what extreme? 

02:35:24.320   02:35:28.960
 And I do not think you can get the answer to that question from learning math. 

02:35:28.980   02:35:32.320
 Humanistic sciences are here to elevate people to proper citizenship. 

02:35:32.640   02:35:34.580
 This is one way of thinking about it. 

02:35:34.920   02:35:38.780
 Yes, it makes you strong, but then the question remains, who owns that power? 

02:35:39.260   02:35:43.680
 So it does not have to be you. It can be mathematics alone, you know? 

02:35:43.680   02:35:46.100
 Because you never know whose agent you are. 

02:35:46.200   02:35:47.000
 Exactly that. 

02:35:47.400   02:35:48.040
 And so ... 

02:35:49.240   02:35:53.080
 You see, I have nothing against computer programmers, anyway, I want you more success. 

02:35:53.140   02:35:55.620
 And mathematicians also, but i ... 

02:35:57.280   02:36:01.640
 Yes, it must be a tool for someone or something. 

02:36:01.740   02:36:07.140
 And what humanistic sciences teaches people is what these tools should be used for. 

02:36:07.380   02:36:10.740
 The tools themselves are incredibly powerful. 

02:36:10.900   02:36:16.480
 But this is not necessarily indisputable well, so ... 

02:36:16.920   02:36:20.520
 I have to go because ... okay, quickly. 

02:36:20.520   02:36:21.180
 [LAUGHTER] 

02:36:25.300   02:36:36.220
 All right, you were in a museum in New York where you saw some of the original Renaissance works in the arts and these works are generally accepted as miraculous artefacts. 

02:36:40.600   02:36:53.040
 Does the original work, unlike the copy, contains the spirit of the artist who created it, and is that the difference between the price of the original and the copy? 

02:36:53.080   02:36:54.120
 Actually, yes. 

02:36:54.120   02:36:55.920
 I know a very good portrait painter, all right? 

02:36:56.440   02:37:01.780
 And one of the things he told me about a good portrait is that he has time. 

02:37:02.140   02:37:04.800
 Because the photographer is one example. 

02:37:05.260   02:37:10.860
 But portrait is the artist's layer, on the second layer, on the second layer. So it has a thickness. 

02:37:11.180   02:37:18.180
 You know? And I think we can see this thick original, but it is also a direct manifestation of this creative perception act. 

02:37:18.540   02:37:24.500
 I do not think you get it in a copy, you simply can not show it with a true copy of that original. 

02:37:24.500   02:37:28.520
 But more than that, because the picture does not end with a frame .. 

02:37:28.700   02:37:38.520
 You know, sometimes we think of the picture itself as an object, but most of the objects have revived through the historical context. 

02:37:38.520   02:37:43.960
 And you can tell, so the historical context is not an object, but it depends on what you mean under the object. 

02:37:44.160   02:37:49.160
 And people often buy a picture, buying a historical context. 

02:37:49.160   02:37:51.280
 And you just can not get it with a copy 

02:37:51.600   02:37:53.140
 And that's one way, magic. 

02:37:53.400   02:37:56.860
 It's like, do you want Elvis's guitar, or some other guitar that's the same as that? 

02:37:57.420   02:37:59.120
 Well, you want lEvisou guitar. 

02:37:59.120   02:38:02.520
 Why? You can not know Elvis's guitar is just when you see it. 

02:38:05.700   02:38:08.440
 [Laughter] 

02:38:11.560   02:38:15.380
 Well, that's at the detail level, but not at the context level. 

02:38:15.480   02:38:16.740
 That looks to me. 

02:38:16.900   02:38:26.780
 All right, we have to go. [APPLAUSE] Thank you.
