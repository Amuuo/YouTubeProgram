   I thought we would start things
  

00:03:56.410   00:03:58.770  
   I thought we would start things
off     with     the

off with   many in the

well   is  

00:04:29.490   00:04:29.500  
well   I guess the most relevant detail is
  

00:04:29.500   00:04:35.450  
well   I guess the most relevant detail is
that     about     this  

00:04:35.450   00:04:35.460  
that I spent about   this
  

00:04:35.460   00:04:40.440  
that I spent about   this
and     hours     a  

00:04:40.440   00:04:40.450  
and I worked on it   a
  

00:04:40.450   00:04:43.080  
and I worked on it   a
day     day     time  

00:04:43.080   00:04:43.090  
day every day   that period of time
  

00:04:43.090   00:04:48.180  
day every day   that period of time 
   finishing  

00:04:48.180   00:04:48.190  
  and at at the same time I was finishing
  

00:04:48.190   00:04:50.970  
  and at at the same time I was finishing 
   lecturing  

00:04:50.970   00:04:50.980  
   and I started lecturing
  

00:04:50.980   00:04:53.510  
   and I started lecturing
at     that  

00:04:53.510   00:04:53.520  
at Harvard but   I was doing that
  

00:04:53.520   00:04:56.100  
at Harvard but   I was doing that
continually     thinking     it  

00:04:56.100   00:04:56.110  
   about it
  

00:04:56.110   00:04:59.340  
   about it
continually    material  

00:04:59.340   00:04:59.350  
continually   and reading the material
  

00:04:59.350   00:05:00.750  
continually   and reading the material
that     order     write  

00:05:00.750   00:05:00.760  
that   to write
  

00:05:00.760   00:05:04.490  
that   to write 
   I  

00:05:04.490   00:05:04.500  
   continually as well and I
  

00:05:04.500   00:05:08.280  
   continually as well and I
didn't     recently     that  

00:05:08.280   00:05:08.290  
didn't realize until more recently   that
  

00:05:08.290   00:05:12.510  
didn't realize until more recently   that 
   the  

00:05:12.510   00:05:12.520  
   the heart of the
  

00:05:12.520   00:05:16.920  
   the heart of the
postmodern     conundrum     was  

00:05:16.920   00:05:16.930  
postmodern conundrum   I would say I was
  

00:05:16.930   00:05:19.440  
postmodern conundrum   I would say I was 
   the  

00:05:19.440   00:05:19.450  
  very much obsessed by the events of the

  very much obsessed by the events of the

   War for reasons I don't exactly

   War for reasons I don't exactly
understand     of     about  

00:05:23.850   00:05:23.860  
understand I had a lot   dreams about

understand I had a lot   dreams about
nuclear     on     I

everyone who was my   age I suppose there

everyone who was my   age I suppose there
there     of     probably  

00:05:38.640   00:05:38.650  
there were lots of   probably

there were lots of   probably
between    in  

00:05:41.460   00:05:41.470  
between   1962 I would say probably in

between   1962 I would say probably in
1985     convinced  

00:05:44.280   00:05:44.290  
1985 where people were   pretty convinced

1985 where people were   pretty convinced
that     war  

00:05:46.800   00:05:46.810  
that   the probability of a nuclear war
  

00:05:46.810   00:05:50.659  
that   the probability of a nuclear war
was     people  

00:05:50.659   00:05:50.669  
was high much   higher now than people
  

00:05:50.669   00:05:55.620  
was high much   higher now than people
considered     about  

00:05:55.620   00:05:55.630  
considered now   and I was curious about

this    everyone

   I was curious about why everyone

   I was curious about why everyone
wasn't     this     time

was this one   the explanation was 
   ways  

00:06:31.409   00:06:31.419  
  that there's a very large number of ways
  

00:06:31.419   00:06:32.850  
  that there's a very large number of ways
that    organize

that   human beings could organize
  

00:06:32.860   00:06:34.740  
that   human beings could organize
themselves     large  

00:06:34.740   00:06:34.750  
themselves in society   like a large
  

00:06:34.750   00:06:36.000  
themselves in society   like a large
number     that     could  

00:06:36.000   00:06:36.010  
number   we could
  

00:06:36.010   00:06:37.860  
number   we could 
   all  

00:06:37.860   00:06:37.870  
  hypothetically play and they're all
  

00:06:37.870   00:06:40.170  
  hypothetically play and they're all
equally     equally  

00:06:40.170   00:06:40.180  
equally arbitrary   in an in an equally
  

00:06:40.180   00:06:42.300  
equally arbitrary   in an in an equally
arbitrary     the  

00:06:42.300   00:06:42.310  
arbitrary universe and that the
 

00:06:42.310   00:06:44.219  
arbitrary universe and that the
   kind  

00:06:44.219   00:06:44.229  
  Communists had decided to play one kind
  

00:06:44.229   00:06:46.830  
  Communists had decided to play one kind
of     the     Western

of game   West and the Western
  

00:06:46.840   00:06:49.650  
of game   West and the Western 
   had

decided   to play another game and it was
  

00:06:51.250   00:06:54.570  
decided   to play another game and it was
all    so  

00:06:54.570   00:06:54.580  
all   arbitrary in some sense and so
  

00:06:54.580   00:06:56.310  
all   arbitrary in some sense and so
that's     trying     out  

00:06:56.310   00:06:56.320  
that's what I was trying   to figure out
  

00:06:56.320   00:06:58.890  
that's what I was trying   to figure out
was     was     this  

00:06:58.890   00:06:58.900  
   on with this
  

00:06:58.900   00:07:01.890  
   on with this 
   battle  

00:07:01.890   00:07:01.900  
  conflict and was it merely a battle
  

00:07:01.900   00:07:05.240  
  conflict and was it merely a battle
between     valid  

00:07:05.240   00:07:05.250  
between   two hypothetically equally valid
  

00:07:05.250   00:07:07.409  
between   two hypothetically equally valid
interpretations     from  

00:07:07.409   00:07:07.419  
interpretations of the world drawn from
 

00:07:07.419   00:07:10.159  
interpretations of the world drawn from
a     potential 

00:07:10.159   00:07:10.169  
a set of extraordinary large potential
 

00:07:10.169   00:07:12.390  
a set of extraordinary large potential
interpretations     think    be  

00:07:12.390   00:07:12.400  
interpretations which I think   would be
  

00:07:12.400   00:07:14.640  
interpretations which I think   would be
essentially     it  

00:07:14.640   00:07:14.650  
essentially a postmodernist   take on it
  

00:07:14.650   00:07:18.980  
essentially a postmodernist   take on it
and     think     problem  

00:07:18.980   00:07:18.990  
and I think   into the problem
  

00:07:18.990   00:07:22.469  
and I think   into the problem
neutrally     knew  

00:07:22.469   00:07:22.479  
neutrally in that   I didn't think I knew
  

00:07:22.479   00:07:25.469  
neutrally in that   I didn't think I knew
what     answer     lots  

00:07:25.469   00:07:25.479  
what   so lots
  

00:07:25.479   00:07:26.820  
what   so lots
of     who

of   times when you talk to people who
  

00:07:26.830   00:07:28.560  
of   times when you talk to people who 
   who  

00:07:28.560   00:07:28.570  
   to people who
  

00:07:28.570   00:07:30.659  
   to people who 
   right  

00:07:30.659   00:07:30.669  
   they have an idea and it's right
  

00:07:30.669   00:07:32.129  
   they have an idea and it's right
and     they're  

00:07:32.129   00:07:32.139  
and then they write   whatever they're
  

00:07:32.139   00:07:34.200  
and then they write   whatever they're
writing     how

of   of rigid communist orthodoxy and
noted     like  

00:16:49.059   00:16:49.069  
  noted very clearly that it was like
  

00:16:49.069   00:16:50.619  
  noted very clearly that it was like
there     was     the  

00:16:50.619   00:16:50.629  
there was   a crank in some sense on the
  

00:16:50.629   00:16:52.030  
there was   a crank in some sense on the
side     you     just  

00:16:52.030   00:16:52.040  
side of   could just

00:16:57.889   00:16:59.740  
ideological   dogma and it's all entirely
predictable     people  

00:16:59.740   00:16:59.750  
predictable   and people
  

00:16:59.750   00:17:01.030  
predictable   and people 
   don't  

00:17:01.030   00:17:01.040  
   situation like that don't
  

00:17:01.040   00:17:03.100  
   situation like that don't
understand     an  

00:17:03.100   00:17:03.110  
understand that   they're possessed by an
  

00:17:03.110   00:17:05.470  
understand that   they're possessed by an
idea    don't  

00:17:05.470   00:17:05.480

  have ideas ideas have people it's like
  

00:17:08.390   00:17:11.260  
  have ideas ideas have people it's like
so     in     that's  

00:17:11.260   00:17:11.270  
so there's   that that's
  

00:17:11.270   00:17:13.720  
so there's   that that's
anything     than     you  

00:17:13.720   00:17:13.730  
anything   exactly what you
  

00:17:13.730   00:17:15.579  
anything   exactly what you
would     deeper  

00:17:15.579   00:17:15.589  
would predict   and then there's a deeper
  

00:17:15.589   00:17:17.199  
would predict   and then there's a deeper
issue    think  

00:17:17.199   00:17:17.209  
issue   I think
  

00:17:17.209   00:17:19.929

   I  

00:21:18.430   00:21:18.440  
  well that's not a very good answer I
  

00:21:18.440   00:21:20.980  
  well that's not a very good answer I

here's how we   know that's happened and
that     happened     think  

00:21:34.720   00:21:34.730  
that hasn't happened   at all now I think
  

00:21:34.730   00:21:36.490  
that hasn't happened   at all now I think
there's     for     think  

00:21:36.490   00:21:36.500  
there's a reason   that I think
  

00:21:36.500   00:21:38.200  
there's a reason   that I think
there's     a  

00:21:38.200   00:21:38.210  
there's a technical   reason as well as a
  

00:21:38.210   00:21:40.240  
there's a technical   reason as well as a

bitter pill to   because that's
equality     a

equality of outcome and for me that's a
 

00:22:22.610   00:22:24.070  
equality of outcome and for me that's a
marker     if    about  

00:22:24.070   00:22:24.080  
marker it's like if   you're talking about

solved this problem and there's a
 

00:44:55.180   00:44:57.630  
solved this problem and there's a

deafening   silence on the intellectual
  

00:44:57.640   00:44:59.609

   for it
so     somewhat     it's

00:51:10.960   00:51:10.970  
strategy that's what fish do in schools
 

00:51:10.970   00:51:13.030  
strategy that's what fish do in schools
of   low-level  

00:51:13.030   00:51:13.040  
of   fish like it's very low-level

  behavior and if you stick your head up
  

00:51:15.050   00:51:17.020  
  behavior and if you stick your head up
there's     real     the  

00:51:17.020   00:51:17.030  
there's some real   and the
  

00:51:17.030   00:51:18.580  
there's some real   and the
advantage     to     are  

00:51:18.580   00:51:18.590  
advantage to   that is that people are
  

00:51:18.590   00:51:20.290  
advantage to   that is that people are
pretty     civilized     with  

00:51:20.290   00:51:20.300  
pretty civilized   and they go along with
  

00:51:20.300   00:51:21.940  
pretty civilized   and they go along with
the     thing  

00:51:21.940   00:51:21.950  
the group   and that's that's a good thing
  

00:51:21.950   00:51:23.560  
the group   and that's that's a good thing
because     you     civilized

because   civilized

   thing when the group goes
  

00:51:26.450   00:51:29.140  
   thing when the group goes
sideways    people  

00:51:29.140   00:51:29.150  
sideways   and I've had many people
  

00:51:29.150   00:51:31.270

take     to     these  

00:55:01.690   00:55:01.700  
take a long time to   prepare these
  

00:55:01.700   00:55:09.549  
take a long time to   prepare these
questions     I  

00:55:09.549   00:55:09.559  
questions didn't you all right so when I
 

00:55:09.559   00:55:10.479  
questions didn't you all right so when I
went     to    Harvard  

00:55:10.479   00:55:10.489  
went to   Harvard
  

00:55:10.489   00:55:14.950  
went to   Harvard 
   lot  

00:55:14.950   00:55:14.960  
   and I had spent a lot
  

00:55:14.960   00:55:18.400  
   and I had spent a lot
of     my     a  

00:55:18.400   00:55:18.410  
of time with my   advisor there and a
  

00:55:18.410   00:55:21.190  
of time with my   advisor there and a
research     had     to  

00:55:21.190   00:55:21.200  
research team   trying to
  

00:55:21.200   00:55:23.170  
research team   trying to
understand     antisocial  

00:55:23.170   00:55:23.180  
understand the genesis of antisocial
 

00:55:23.180   00:55:28.420  
understand the genesis of antisocial
behavior   so  

00:55:28.420   00:55:28.430  
behavior   and among adolescents mostly so
  

00:55:28.430   00:55:31.539  
behavior   and among adolescents mostly so
well     behavior  

00:55:31.539   00:55:31.549  
well as kids as well antisocial behavior
 

00:55:31.549   00:55:33.069  
well as kids as well antisocial behavior
is   a  

00:55:33.069   00:55:33.079  
is   very persistent so if you have a
  

00:55:33.079   00:55:35.319  
is   very persistent so if you have a
child     the  

00:55:35.319   00:55:35.329  
child   whose conduct disordered at the
  

00:55:35.329   00:55:38.200  
child   whose conduct disordered at the
age     they  

00:55:38.200   00:55:38.210  
age of four   the probability that they
  

00:55:38.210   00:55:40.359  
age of four   the probability that they 
   fifteen  

00:55:40.359   00:55:40.369  
   fifteen
  

00:55:40.369   00:55:42.450  
   fifteen
or     it's  

00:55:42.450   00:55:42.460  
or   twenty is extremely high it's
  

00:55:42.460   00:55:45.039  
or   twenty is extremely high it's
unbelievably     stable     dismal  

00:55:45.039   00:55:45.049  
unbelievably stable   it's a very dismal
  

00:55:45.049   00:55:47.259  
unbelievably stable   it's a very dismal
literature     early  

00:55:47.259   00:55:47.269  
literature   because you see these early
  

00:55:47.269   00:55:50.979  
literature   because you see these early
onset     it's  

00:55:50.979   00:55:50.989  
onset   aggressive kids and and it's
  

00:55:50.989   00:55:52.749  
onset   aggressive kids and and it's
persistent     the  

00:55:52.749   00:55:52.759  
  persistent and then you look at the
  

00:55:52.759   00:55:54.940  
  persistent and then you look at the
intervention     up  

00:55:54.940   00:55:54.950  
intervention   literature and you throw up
  

00:55:54.950   00:55:57.339  
intervention   literature and you throw up
your     work  

00:55:57.339   00:55:57.349  
your hands   because no interventions work
  

00:55:57.349   00:55:59.319  
your hands   because no interventions work
and     tried  

00:55:59.319   00:55:59.329  
and believe me psychologists have tried
 

00:55:59.329   00:56:01.150  
and believe me psychologists have tried
   imagine  

00:56:01.150   00:56:01.160  
   imagine
  

00:56:01.160   00:56:03.279  
   imagine 
   in  

00:56:03.279   00:56:03.289  
   in
  

00:56:03.289   00:56:05.559  
   in
order     really  

00:56:05.559   00:56:05.569  
order   to ameliorate that so we're really
  

00:56:05.569   00:56:07.959  
order   to ameliorate that so we're really 
   for  

00:56:07.959   00:56:07.969  
   to understand for
  

00:56:07.969   00:56:10.660  
   to understand for
example    age  

00:56:10.660   00:56:10.670  
example   antisocial by the age
  

00:56:10.670   00:56:13.329  
example   antisocial by the age
of     intervention  

00:56:13.329   00:56:13.339  
of   four then there isn't an intervention
  

00:56:13.339   00:56:16.569  
of   four then there isn't an intervention 
   the

   be effective so and the
  

00:56:16.579   00:56:18.609  
   be effective so and the
standard    really  

00:56:18.609   00:56:18.619  
standard   penological theory is really
  

00:56:18.619   00:56:20.799  
standard   penological theory is really 
   because  

00:56:20.799   00:56:20.809  
   because
  

00:56:20.809   00:56:22.630  
   because
what     aggression  

00:56:22.630   00:56:22.640  
what you see   is that male aggression
  

00:56:22.640   00:56:24.670  
what you see   is that male aggression
Peaks     of     it  

00:56:24.670   00:56:24.680  
Peaks   then it
  

00:56:24.680   00:56:27.249  
Peaks   then it
declines     precipitously     and  

00:56:27.249   00:56:27.259  
declines fairly precipitously   and and
  

00:56:27.259   00:56:29.890  
declines fairly precipitously   and and
and     age  

00:56:29.890   00:56:29.900  
and sort of normalizes again by the age
 

00:56:29.900   00:56:32.200  
and sort of normalizes again by the age
of   theory  

00:56:32.200   00:56:32.210  
of   and standard penological theory
  

00:56:32.210   00:56:34.420  
of   and standard penological theory
essentially     this     it's  

00:56:34.420   00:56:34.430  
essentially   cold-hearted it's
  

00:56:34.430   00:56:36.459  
essentially   cold-hearted it's
like     a     have  

00:56:36.459   00:56:36.469  
like if you have a   if you have
  

00:56:36.469   00:56:38.019  
like if you have a   if you have
someone     offender     you  

00:56:38.019   00:56:38.029  
someone who's a multiple offender   you
  

00:56:38.029   00:56:39.069  
someone who's a multiple offender   you
just     throw     they're  

00:56:39.069   00:56:39.079  
just throw   prison till they're
  

00:56:39.079   00:56:42.940  
just throw   prison till they're 
   that's  

00:56:42.940   00:56:42.950  
   it and that's
  

00:56:42.950   00:56:44.799  
   it and that's
all     what  

00:56:44.799   00:56:44.809  
all there is to it   that's that's what
  

00:56:44.809   00:56:46.420  
all there is to it   that's that's what
we've     now  

00:56:46.420   00:56:46.430  
we've got now
 

00:56:46.430   00:56:47.740  
we've got now
there's     that    because  

00:56:47.740   00:56:47.750  
there's some downside to that   because
  

00:56:47.750   00:56:49.240  
there's some downside to that   because
there's     that  

00:56:49.240   00:56:49.250  
  there's a corollary literature that
  

00:56:49.250   00:56:50.770  
  there's a corollary literature that 
   you  

00:56:50.770   00:56:50.780  
   the worst thing that you
  

00:56:50.780   00:56:52.390  
   the worst thing that you 
   to  

00:56:52.390   00:56:52.400  
  can do with antisocial people is to
  

00:56:52.400   00:56:54.549  
  can do with antisocial people is to
group     do  

00:56:54.549   00:56:54.559  
group them together   which is what we do
  

00:56:54.559   00:56:56.799  
group them together   which is what we do
in     mess  

00:56:56.799   00:56:56.809  
in prisons   so so that's a whole mess
  

00:56:56.809   00:56:59.349  
in prisons   so so that's a whole mess
anyways     of     doing  

00:56:59.349   00:56:59.359  
   things we were doing
  

00:56:59.359   00:57:00.700  
   things we were doing 
   be  

00:57:00.700   00:57:00.710  
  was trying to see if there might be
  

00:57:00.710   00:57:03.220  
  was trying to see if there might be
cognitive     antisocial  

00:57:03.220   00:57:03.230  
cognitive predictors of   antisocial
  

00:57:03.230   00:57:05.950  
cognitive predictors of   antisocial 
   of  

00:57:05.950   00:57:05.960  
  behavior and so we used this battery of
  

00:57:05.960   00:57:07.870  
  behavior and so we used this battery of
neuropsychological     put  

00:57:07.870   00:57:07.880  
neuropsychological tests that was put
 

00:57:07.880   00:57:08.980  
neuropsychological tests that was put
together     the    Neurological  

00:57:08.980   00:57:08.990  
together at the   Montreal Neurological
  

00:57:08.990   00:57:11.380  
together at the   Montreal Neurological
Institute     hours     to  

00:57:11.380   00:57:11.390  
Institute   to
  

00:57:11.390   00:57:13.599  
Institute   to
administer     hypothetically     assess  

00:57:13.599   00:57:13.609  
administer and hypothetically   assess
  

00:57:13.609   00:57:16.180  
administer and hypothetically   assess
prefrontal     we  

00:57:16.180   00:57:16.190  
prefrontal cortical function and we
 

00:57:16.190   00:57:18.490  
prefrontal cortical function and we
   90  

00:57:18.490   00:57:18.500  
   90
  

00:57:18.500   00:57:21.720  
   90 
   antisocial  

00:57:21.720   00:57:21.730  
   then assessed antisocial
  

00:57:21.730   00:57:24.280  
   then assessed antisocial
adolescents     in     out  

00:57:24.280   00:57:24.290  
adolescents in in   and found out
  

00:57:24.290   00:57:26.230  
adolescents in in   and found out
that     in     the  

00:57:26.230   00:57:26.240  
that   the
  

00:57:26.240   00:57:27.910  
that   the
problem-solving     we  

00:57:27.910   00:57:27.920  
problem-solving ability that we
 

00:57:27.920   00:57:32.490  
problem-solving ability that we
associated     ability 

00:57:32.490   00:57:32.500  
associated with with prefrontal ability
 

00:57:32.500   00:57:34.780  
associated with with prefrontal ability
   well  

00:57:34.780   00:57:34.790  
  when I got to Harvard I thought well
  

00:57:34.790   00:57:37.240  
  when I got to Harvard I thought well
that's    the  

00:57:37.240   00:57:37.250  
that's   interesting we could use the
  

00:57:37.250   00:57:40.059  
that's   interesting we could use the
neuro     negative  

00:57:40.059   00:57:40.069  
neuro psych battery to predict negative
 

00:57:40.069   00:57:42.880  
neuro psych battery to predict negative
behavior     use    to  

00:57:42.880   00:57:42.890  
behavior perhaps we could use   to
  

00:57:42.890   00:57:44.859  
behavior perhaps we could use   to
predict     thought  

00:57:44.859   00:57:44.869  
predict positive   behavior so I thought
  

00:57:44.869   00:57:46.569  
predict positive   behavior so I thought
well     psych  

00:57:46.569   00:57:46.579  
well what if   we turned the neuro psych
  

00:57:46.579   00:57:49.839  
well what if   we turned the neuro psych
battery     we  

00:57:49.839   00:57:49.849  
battery   and over and thought well can we
  

00:57:49.849   00:57:51.910  
battery   and over and thought well can we 
   you  

00:57:51.910   00:57:51.920  
  predict grades for example because you
  

00:57:51.920   00:57:53.620  
  predict grades for example because you
know     a     so  

00:57:53.620   00:57:53.630  
know that's   predict so
  

00:57:53.630   00:57:56.500  
know that's   predict so
we     that  

00:57:56.500   00:57:56.510  
we ran a study we ran a study that
 

00:57:56.510   00:57:58.690  
we ran a study we ran a study that
   of  

00:57:58.690   00:57:58.700  
  looked at Harvard kids University of
  

00:57:58.700   00:58:01.299  
  looked at Harvard kids University of
Toronto     Milwaukee  

00:58:01.299   00:58:01.309  
Toronto kids line workers at a Milwaukee
 

00:58:01.309   00:58:04.329  
Toronto kids line workers at a Milwaukee
   at  

00:58:04.329   00:58:04.339  
  Factory and managers and executives at
  

00:58:04.339   00:58:06.160  
  Factory and managers and executives at
the     same     was  

00:58:06.160   00:58:06.170  
the same   Factory and what we found was
  

00:58:06.170   00:58:09.940  
the same   Factory and what we found was
that     these  

00:58:09.940   00:58:09.950  
that the average   score across these
  

00:58:09.950   00:58:11.740  
that the average   score across these
neuropsychological     kind  

00:58:11.740   00:58:11.750  
neuropsychological tests they were kind
 

00:58:11.750   00:58:13.569  
neuropsychological tests they were kind
of     you 

00:58:13.569   00:58:13.579  
of like games they were game-like you
 

00:58:13.579   00:58:16.660  
of like games they were game-like you
know     in    there  

00:58:16.660   00:58:16.670  
know so in one in   one test you had there
  

00:58:16.670   00:58:18.220  
know so in one in   one test you had there
were     middle     the  

00:58:18.220   00:58:18.230  
were five lights in the middle   of the
  

00:58:18.230   00:58:20.530  
were five lights in the middle   of the

everyone   to do everything that's wrong
and     of     of  

01:02:20.380   01:02:20.390  
and here's one of   the consequences of
  

01:02:20.390   01:02:22.720  
and here's one of   the consequences of
that    Forces  

01:02:22.720   01:02:22.730  
that   so as I mentioned the Armed Forces
  

01:02:22.730   01:02:24.940  
that   so as I mentioned the Armed Forces
has     lot     they  

01:02:24.940   01:02:24.950  
has done a lot   and they
  

01:02:24.950   01:02:27.609  
has done a lot   and they
started     back     they  

01:02:27.609   01:02:27.619  
started back   the reason they
  

01:02:27.619   01:02:29.710  
started back   the reason they
did     that     obvious  

01:02:29.710   01:02:29.720  
did that   obvious
  

01:02:29.720   01:02:32.319  
did that   obvious
reasons     and  

01:02:32.319   01:02:32.329  
  reasons say let's say there's a war and
  

01:02:32.329   01:02:35.049  
  reasons say let's say there's a war and 
   into

possible   or you'll lose so that's a
reason     has  

01:02:42.130   01:02:42.140  
reason and now the Armed Forces has
 

01:02:42.140   01:02:45.609  
reason and now the Armed Forces has
   and  

01:02:45.609   01:02:45.619

in the last   as
a     of     was  

01:02:51.640   01:02:51.650  
a consequence of   that analysis which was
  

01:02:51.650   01:02:53.589  
a consequence of   that analysis which was
that     was     anyone  

01:02:53.589   01:02:53.599  
that it was   illegal to induct anyone
  

01:02:53.599   01:02:55.390  
that it was   illegal to induct anyone
into     who     of

into the Armed Forces who   had an IQ of
  

01:02:55.400   01:02:59.440  
into the Armed Forces who   had an IQ of
less     why     and  

01:02:59.440   01:02:59.450  
   and
  

01:02:59.450   01:03:02.680  
   and
the     that     in  

01:03:02.680   01:03:02.690  
the answer was all of that   effort put in
  

01:03:02.690   01:03:04.450  
the answer was all of that   effort put in
by    if  

01:03:04.450   01:03:04.460  
by   armed forces indicated that if
  

01:03:04.460   01:03:06.460  
by   armed forces indicated that if
you     IQ     wasn't  

01:03:06.460   01:03:06.470  
you had an IQ   of 83 or less there wasn't
  

01:03:06.470   01:03:07.990  
you had an IQ   of 83 or less there wasn't
anything     do  

01:03:07.990   01:03:08.000  
anything that   you could be trained to do
  

01:03:08.000   01:03:09.819  
anything that   you could be trained to do
in     the     positively  

01:03:09.819   01:03:09.829  
in the   military that wasn't positively
  

01:03:09.829   01:03:12.009  
in the   military that wasn't positively
counterproductive     to     think  

01:03:12.009   01:03:12.019  
counterproductive   think
  

01:03:12.019   01:03:14.559  
counterproductive   think 
   is  

01:03:14.559   01:03:14.569  
   a because the military is
  

01:03:14.569   01:03:17.230  
   a because the military is
chronically     right  

01:03:17.230   01:03:17.240  
chronically desperate for   people right
  

01:03:17.240   01:03:18.460  
chronically desperate for   people right 
   not  

01:03:18.460   01:03:18.470  
   like they're it's not
  

01:03:18.470   01:03:20.650  
   like they're it's not 
   inducted  

01:03:20.650   01:03:20.660  
   inducted
  

01:03:20.660   01:03:22.329  
   inducted
right     go     recruit  

01:03:22.329   01:03:22.339  
right they have to go   out and recruit
  

01:03:22.339   01:03:24.400  
right they have to go   out and recruit
and     easy     they're  

01:03:24.400   01:03:24.410  
   and so they're
  

01:03:24.410   01:03:25.599  
   and so they're
desperate    on  

01:03:25.599   01:03:25.609  
desperate   to get their hands on
  

01:03:25.609   01:03:27.069  
desperate   to get their hands on
everybody     them  

01:03:27.069   01:03:27.079  
everybody they can   pass them
  

01:03:27.079   01:03:29.859  
everybody they can   pass them 
   wartime  

01:03:29.859   01:03:29.869  
   in wartime
  

01:03:29.869   01:03:31.839  
   in wartime 
   was  

01:03:31.839   01:03:31.849  
  but also in peacetime but then there was
  

01:03:31.849   01:03:33.309  
  but also in peacetime but then there was
another     reason     Armed  

01:03:33.309   01:03:33.319  
another reason   to which was the Armed
  

01:03:33.319   01:03:35.380  
another reason   to which was the Armed 
   policy  

01:03:35.380   01:03:35.390  
  Forces was also set up from a policy
  

01:03:35.390   01:03:38.019  
  Forces was also set up from a policy
perspective     the  

01:03:38.019   01:03:38.029  
  perspective to take people in the
  

01:03:38.029   01:03:40.479  
  perspective to take people in the
underclass     and  

01:03:40.479   01:03:40.489  
underclass let's say   and train them and
  

01:03:40.489   01:03:42.190  
underclass let's say   and train them and
move     them     working  

01:03:42.190   01:03:42.200  
move them   working
  

01:03:42.200   01:03:43.569  
move them   working
class     so  

01:03:43.569   01:03:43.579  
class or   maybe the middle class so
  

01:03:43.579   01:03:45.279  
class or   maybe the middle class so
there's     and  

01:03:45.279   01:03:45.289  
there's a policy element to it too   and
  

01:03:45.289   01:03:47.289  
there's a policy element to it too   and
so     that     could  

01:03:47.289   01:03:47.299  
so   could
  

01:03:47.299   01:03:49.269  
so   could
see     desperate     to  

01:03:49.269   01:03:49.279  
see   to
  

01:03:49.279   01:03:52.299  
see   to
bring     people     of  

01:03:52.299   01:03:52.309  
bring people   well with an IQ of
  

01:03:52.309   01:03:55.359  
bring people   well with an IQ of
83     so  

01:03:55.359   01:03:55.369  
83 or less it's not happening   okay so
  

01:03:55.369   01:03:58.380  
83 or less it's not happening   okay so
how     people     less  

01:03:58.380   01:03:58.390  
how many people   IQ of 83 or less
  

01:03:58.390   01:04:06.430  
how many people   IQ of 83 or less 
   that  

01:04:06.430   01:04:06.440  
   doesn't if that
  

01:04:06.440   01:04:09.219  
   doesn't if that
doesn't     you     didn't  

01:04:09.219   01:04:09.229  
doesn't hurt you   here then you didn't
  

01:04:09.229   01:04:11.859  
doesn't hurt you   here then you didn't
hear     properly     implies  

01:04:11.859   01:04:11.869  
hear it   what it implies
  

01:04:11.869   01:04:14.829  
hear it   what it implies

people    that's  

01:09:46.349   01:09:46.359  
people   might say well that's
  

01:09:46.359   01:09:49.420  
people   might say well that's
socio-cultural     it's     and  

01:09:49.420   01:09:49.430  
socio-cultural it's like no   not and
  

01:09:49.430   01:09:52.030  
socio-cultural it's like no   not and 
   up  

01:09:52.030   01:09:52.040  
   if you stack up
  

01:09:52.040   01:09:54.910  
   if you stack up
countries     egalitarian  

01:09:54.910   01:09:54.920  
countries by their by their egalitarian
 

01:09:54.920   01:09:57.460  
countries by their by their egalitarian
   quite  

01:09:57.460   01:09:57.470  
   quite
  

01:09:57.470   01:09:59.520  
   quite
effectively     the  

01:09:59.520   01:09:59.530  
effectively   and then you look at the
  

01:09:59.530   01:10:02.020  
effectively   and then you look at the 
   STEM  

01:10:02.020   01:10:02.030  
  over-representation of men in STEM
  

01:10:02.030   01:10:05.260  
  over-representation of men in STEM
fields    increases  

01:10:05.260   01:10:05.270  
fields   the over-representation increases
  

01:10:05.270   01:10:08.110  
fields   the over-representation increases
as     more     egalitarian  

01:10:08.110   01:10:08.120  
as the countries become more   egalitarian
  

01:10:08.120   01:10:12.730  
as the countries become more   egalitarian
so     socio-cultural     men  

01:10:12.730   01:10:12.740  
so it's not socio-cultural   okay now men
  

01:10:12.740   01:10:14.860  
so it's not socio-cultural   okay now men
aren't    in  

01:10:14.860   01:10:14.870  
aren't   more interested in

aren't   more interested in

   same

you     much     that  

01:10:44.470   01:10:44.480  
you might ask   that
  

01:10:44.480   01:10:46.270  
you might ask   that
is     in  

01:10:46.270   01:10:46.280  
is best   place to look at that is in
  

01:10:46.280   01:10:48.340  
is best   place to look at that is in
Sweden     the     policies  

01:10:48.340   01:10:48.350  
Sweden where the   Aryan policies
  

01:10:48.350   01:10:50.170  
Sweden where the   Aryan policies
have     out     of  

01:10:50.170   01:10:50.180  
have been   a long period of
  

01:10:50.180   01:10:52.150  
have been   a long period of
time    more  

01:10:52.150   01:10:52.160  
time   can get a more
  

01:10:52.160   01:10:54.550  
time   can get a more
direct     about     you  

01:10:54.550   01:10:54.560  
direct inference about   biology if you
  

01:10:54.560   01:10:56.500  
direct inference about   biology if you
took     a     woman  

01:10:56.500   01:10:56.510  
took a   random man and around and woman
  

01:10:56.510   01:10:59.050  
took a   random man and around and woman
out    bet  

01:10:59.050   01:10:59.060  
out   you had to bet
  

01:10:59.060   01:11:01.030  
out   you had to bet
on     bet  

01:11:01.030   01:11:01.040  
on who was more aggressive   and you bet
  

01:11:01.040   01:11:02.950  
on who was more aggressive   and you bet
on    of  

01:11:02.950   01:11:02.960  
on   60 percent of
  

01:11:02.960   01:11:05.200  
on   60 percent of
the     right  

01:11:05.200   01:11:05.210  
the time   so that's not that much right
  

01:11:05.210   01:11:07.450  
the time   so that's not that much right 
   it's  

01:11:07.450   01:11:07.460  
   it's deviates from 50/50 but it's
  

01:11:07.460   01:11:12.040  
   it's deviates from 50/50 but it's
not     like     so  

01:11:12.040   01:11:12.050  
not like   ninety ten it's 60/40 okay so
  

01:11:12.050   01:11:14.740  
not like   ninety ten it's 60/40 okay so
so    a  

01:11:14.740   01:11:14.750  
so   what does that mean well we got a
  

01:11:14.750   01:11:16.630  
so   what does that mean well we got a
tail     say     that  

01:11:16.630   01:11:16.640  
tail problem here again let's say   that
  

01:11:16.640   01:11:18.460  
tail problem here again let's say   that
now     to     the  

01:11:18.460   01:11:18.470  
now   go out on to the
  

01:11:18.470   01:11:20.380  
now   go out on to the
extremes     and     identify  

01:11:20.380   01:11:20.390  
extremes of aggression and   identify
  

01:11:20.390   01:11:22.900  
extremes of aggression and   identify
the     one     hundred  

01:11:22.900   01:11:22.910  
the most aggressive one   in a hundred
  

01:11:22.910   01:11:27.580  
the most aggressive one   in a hundred
persons     in  

01:11:27.580   01:11:27.590

01:26:55.450   01:26:55.460  
  those and then we asked we turned them
  

01:26:55.460   01:26:57.160  
  those and then we asked we turned them 
   thousand  

01:26:57.160   01:26:57.170  
  into questions and we asked a thousand
  

01:26:57.170   01:26:59.140  
  into questions and we asked a thousand
people     their     can  

01:26:59.140   01:26:59.150  
people   then you can
  

01:26:59.150   01:27:01.390  
people   then you can
do     a  

01:27:01.390   01:27:01.400  
do this statistical process called a
 

01:27:01.400   01:27:03.370  
do this statistical process called a
factor   thing  

01:27:03.370   01:27:03.380  
factor   analysis and it's the same thing
  

01:27:03.380   01:27:05.290  
factor   analysis and it's the same thing 
   IQ  

01:27:05.290   01:27:05.300  
   single factor of IQ
  

01:27:05.300   01:27:06.610  
   single factor of IQ
from     example

from   a group of questions for example
  

01:27:06.620   01:27:08.140  
from   a group of questions for example 
   the  

01:27:08.140   01:27:08.150  
   the same thing that produced the

   the same thing that produced the

01:27:10.480   01:27:10.490  
Big Five   what the
  

01:27:10.490   01:27:13.480  
Big Five   what the
factor     which  

01:27:13.480   01:27:13.490  
factor analysis does is   tell you which

factor analysis does is   tell you which
quest     so  

01:27:16.300   01:27:16.310  
quest if questions group together   so
  

01:27:16.310   01:27:19.900  
quest if questions group together   so 
   you  

01:27:19.900   01:27:19.910  
  let's say you have opinion a well if you
  

01:27:19.910   01:27:21.370  
  let's say you have opinion a well if you
have     a     of

   there's
  

01:27:28.280   01:27:30.640  
   there's
something     now

something about them   that's the same now
  

01:27:30.650   01:27:32.470  
something about them   that's the same now
what     could     when  

01:27:32.470   01:27:32.480  
what we could   have found was that when
  

01:27:32.480   01:27:34.480  
what we could   have found was that when 
   there  

01:27:34.480   01:27:34.490  
   there
  

01:27:34.490   01:27:37.210  
   there
was    would  

01:27:37.210   01:27:37.220  
was   like 50 clumps and so that would
  

01:27:37.220   01:27:39.460  
was   like 50 clumps and so that would 
   as

the water   happened
  

01:27:43.250   01:27:45.460  
the water   happened
we     looked  

01:27:45.460   01:27:45.470  
we   found two clumps one of which looked
  

01:27:45.470   01:27:48.040  
we   found two clumps one of which looked
like     and  

01:27:48.040   01:27:48.050  
like   something like moderate leftism and
  

01:27:48.050   01:27:49.620  
like   something like moderate leftism and
the     other     like  

01:27:49.620   01:27:49.630  
the other   much like
  

01:27:49.630   01:27:51.880  
the other   much like
totalitarian    and  

01:27:51.880   01:27:51.890  
totalitarian   political correctness and
  

01:27:51.890   01:27:55.480  
totalitarian   political correctness and
it     we  

01:27:55.480   01:27:55.490  
it was very   very robust finding and we
  

01:27:55.490   01:27:57.580  
it was very   very robust finding and we
replicated     this     for

replicated   for
  

01:27:57.590   01:28:00.970  
replicated   for
her     way     then  

01:28:00.970   01:28:00.980  
her master's thesis by the way   and then
  

01:28:00.980   01:28:02.650  
her master's thesis by the way   and then
we     these  

01:28:02.650   01:28:02.660  
we looked at what predicted   these
  

01:28:02.660   01:28:04.690  
we looked at what predicted   these
beliefs     the  

01:28:04.690   01:28:04.700  
beliefs   first of all that the
  

01:28:04.700   01:28:06.850

clump of questions and the radical
 

01:28:08.840   01:28:10.300  
clump of questions and the radical
leftist     questions    actually  

01:28:10.300   01:28:10.310  
leftist clump of questions   actually
  

01:28:10.310   01:28:12.310  
leftist clump of questions   actually
wasn't    the

wasn't   the
  

01:28:12.320   01:28:14.200  
wasn't   the
things     there's  

01:28:14.200   01:28:14.210  
things that we surmise is that there's
 

01:28:14.210   01:28:16.150  
things that we surmise is that there's
an     actual    between

an actual   the left between

   the radicals and
  

01:28:17.630   01:28:20.440  
   the radicals and
that's     itself     I  

01:28:20.440   01:28:20.450  
that's just   I
  

01:28:20.450   01:28:21.580  
that's just   I
think     can     that  

01:28:21.580   01:28:21.590  
   actually see that
  

01:28:21.590   01:28:23.230  
   actually see that 
   the  

01:28:23.230   01:28:23.240  
   of the
  

01:28:23.240   01:28:25.540

radical leftists to devour themselves
 

01:28:25.550   01:28:27.700  
radical leftists to devour themselves
right     happens    regular  

01:28:27.700   01:28:27.710  
right so which happens   on a very regular

after   the moderates when the martyrs
  

01:28:34.820   01:28:37.240  
after   the moderates when the martyrs
criticize     so

what   found almost invariably with the

what   found almost invariably with the

personality   if you look at
differences     women     and

differences   and
  

01:29:11.659   01:29:14.109  
differences   and
then     you     the

then you   control for personality the

then you   control for personality the
differences     not  

01:29:15.819   01:29:15.829  
differences go away   so they're not

  but with political correctness we found
an    a

research     and     the  

01:29:52.209   01:29:52.219  
research is very very smart and   the
  

01:29:52.219   01:29:53.799  
research is very very smart and   the
study     it's  

01:29:53.799   01:29:53.809  
study was   well done so I think it's
  

01:29:53.809   01:29:56.830  
study was   well done so I think it's
credible     that's  

01:29:56.830   01:29:56.840  
credible so and one of the things that's
 

01:29:56.840   01:29:58.600  
credible so and one of the things that's
   it  

01:29:58.600   01:29:58.610  
   that it
  

01:29:58.610   01:30:01.719  
   that it

does tie   the Freudian nightmare of

does tie   the Freudian nightmare of

the   mother essentially which
  

01:30:03.979   01:30:06.189  
the   mother essentially which
was     contribution  

01:30:06.189   01:30:06.199  
was Freud's I think signal contribution
 

01:30:06.199   01:30:08.169  
was Freud's I think signal contribution
to     psychopathology    most  

01:30:08.169   01:30:08.179  
to psychopathology   you know for most
  

01:30:08.179   01:30:10.330  
to psychopathology   you know for most
most     who  

01:30:10.330   01:30:10.340  
most of Freud's clients were people who
 

01:30:10.340   01:30:11.949  
most of Freud's clients were people who
were     struggling    the  

01:30:11.949   01:30:11.959  
were struggling   to get out of the
  

01:30:11.959   01:30:14.799  
were struggling   to get out of the
clutches     part  

01:30:14.799   01:30:14.809  
clutches of their family right and part
 

01:30:14.809   01:30:16.299  
clutches of their family right and part
of     are    very  

01:30:16.299   01:30:16.309  
of that is human beings are   very
  

01:30:16.309   01:30:18.580  
of that is human beings are   very
dependent    we  

01:30:18.580   01:30:18.590  
dependent   right because well because we
  

01:30:18.590   01:30:20.350  
dependent   right because well because we
have     of  

01:30:20.350   01:30:20.360  
have this incredibly long period of
 

01:30:20.360   01:30:22.779  
have this incredibly long period of
   but  

01:30:22.779   01:30:22.789  
   thirty years maybe but
  

01:30:22.789   01:30:25.479  
   thirty years maybe but
certainly    it's  

01:30:25.479   01:30:25.489  
certainly   eighteen years and so it's
  

01:30:25.489   01:30:28.719  
certainly   eighteen years and so it's
hard     mature  

01:30:28.719   01:30:28.729  
hard to   struggle up from infancy mature
  

01:30:28.729   01:30:31.540  
hard to   struggle up from infancy mature
and     and  

01:30:31.540   01:30:31.550  
and leave as an independent creature and
 

01:30:31.550   01:30:33.069  
and leave as an independent creature and
lots     people    if  

01:30:33.069   01:30:33.079  
lots of people   you see this and if
  

01:30:33.079   01:30:34.389  
lots of people   you see this and if
you're     the  

01:30:34.389   01:30:34.399  
you're a clinician   you see this all the
  

01:30:34.399   01:30:36.040  
you're a clinician   you see this all the

01:30:36.040   01:30:36.050  
   are so tangled up in their

   are so tangled up in their

01:30:37.689   01:30:37.699  
families that they can't get away from
 

01:30:37.699   01:30:39.969  
families that they can't get away from
   situation  

01:30:39.969   01:30:39.979  
  them and that's the eatable situation
  

01:30:39.979   01:30:42.909  
  them and that's the eatable situation
that     so  

01:30:42.909   01:30:42.919  
that Freud described so so so
 

01:30:42.919   01:30:45.969  
that Freud described so so so

hyper dependence right it's it's   the
danger     of     a

danger   now there's a

that     themselves     of

that they can do themselves   it's kind of
  

01:31:04.190   01:31:06.100  
that they can do themselves   it's kind of
a     rule     someone  

01:31:06.100   01:31:06.110  
a harsh rule   you know if you see someone

   maybe

over and   maybe you 
   to  

01:31:14.500   01:31:14.510  
   learn how to

with hyper protectiveness   it's exactly
what     see  

01:31:57.820   01:31:57.830  
what you'd   expect and then what you see

  playing out in the political landscape
  

01:31:59.300   01:32:01.660  
  playing out in the political landscape
as     I     and  

01:32:01.660   01:32:01.670  
as far as   tell and
  

01:32:01.670   01:32:04.990  
as far as   tell and 
   an  

01:32:04.990   01:32:05.000  
   there's an
  

01:32:05.000   01:32:06.550  
   there's an 
   oppressor  

01:32:06.550   01:32:06.560  
  inequality there's an oppressor
  

01:32:06.560   01:32:09.450  
  inequality there's an oppressor 
   whose

stacks up at the bottom   of a hierarchy
is     victim     at  

01:32:15.340   01:32:15.350  
is a victim   slash infant and anyone at
  

01:32:15.350   01:32:17.740  
is a victim   slash infant and anyone at
the     predator

the top is an oppressor slash predator
 

01:32:17.750   01:32:20.950  
the top is an oppressor slash predator
and     think    hierarchical  

01:32:20.950   01:32:20.960  
and I think   confusing the hierarchical
  

01:32:20.960   01:32:23.230  
and I think   confusing the hierarchical
structure     especially     on  

01:32:23.230   01:32:23.240  
structure   when it's based on
  

01:32:23.240   01:32:26.110  
structure   when it's based on
competence    of  

01:32:26.110   01:32:26.120  
competence   and Western structures of
  

01:32:26.120   01:32:28.480  
competence   and Western structures of
hierarchy     part  

01:32:28.480   01:32:28.490  
hierarchy are based in   large part
  

01:32:28.490   01:32:30.660  
hierarchy are based in   large part 
   competence  

01:32:30.660   01:32:30.670  
  although not entirely on competence
  

01:32:30.670   01:32:34.410  
  although not entirely on competence
confusing    or  

01:32:34.410   01:32:34.420  
confusing   that with a predator infant or

you     think     worthwhile  

01:37:38.060   01:37:38.070  
you obviously think   it's worthwhile

you     standing     a  

01:37:43.760   01:37:43.770  
you think that standing   up and asking a
  

01:37:43.770   01:37:46.250  
you think that standing   up and asking a
question     up  

01:37:46.250   01:37:46.260  
question is better than not standing up
 

01:37:46.260   01:37:48.170  
question is better than not standing up
   a  

01:37:48.170   01:37:48.180  
  and asking a question yes okay that's a
  

01:37:48.180   01:37:51.050  
  and asking a question yes okay that's a
hierarchy    without  

01:37:51.050   01:37:51.060  
hierarchy   yes okay without
  

01:37:51.060   01:37:53.060  
hierarchy   yes okay without 
   act  

01:37:53.060   01:37:53.070  
   couldn't act
  

01:37:53.070   01:37:56.120  
   couldn't act
of     course     it's  

01:37:56.120   01:37:56.130  
   it's
  

01:37:56.130   01:37:58.220  
   it's 
   hierarchy  

01:37:58.220   01:37:58.230  
  hardly why I'm defending the hierarchy
  

01:37:58.230   01:38:01.700  
  hardly why I'm defending the hierarchy
without     the     that

01:42:28.939   01:42:28.949  
so I'm I've got more   than my fair share
  

01:42:28.949   01:42:31.850  
so I'm I've got more   than my fair share
of     them  

01:42:31.850   01:42:31.860  
of faults and a temper is one of them
 

01:42:31.860   01:42:41.029  
of faults and a temper is one of them
but     through    I'm  

01:42:41.029   01:42:41.039  
but I'm muddling through   alright I'm
  

01:42:41.039   01:42:42.890  
but I'm muddling through   alright I'm
almost    question  

01:42:42.890   01:42:42.900  
almost   well hesitant to ask a question
  

01:42:42.900   01:42:48.799  
almost   well hesitant to ask a question
now    wondering  

01:42:48.799   01:42:48.809  
now   but so one thing I was wondering
  

01:42:48.809   01:42:50.390  
now   but so one thing I was wondering
about     of     would  

01:42:50.390   01:42:50.400  
about was a lot of   people I think would
  

01:42:50.400   01:42:53.629  
about was a lot of   people I think would
argue     of     Western  

01:42:53.629   01:42:53.639  
argue that   Western
  

01:42:53.639   01:42:56.569  
argue that   Western
civilization     the     of  

01:42:56.569   01:42:56.579  
civilization   right of
  

01:42:56.579   01:42:59.060  
civilization   right of
the     church  

01:42:59.060   01:42:59.070  
the individual   separation between church
  

01:42:59.070   01:43:03.109  
the individual   separation between church
and     state     so  

01:43:03.109   01:43:03.119  
and state   not so
  

01:43:03.119   01:43:06.220  
and state   not so
much     the  

01:43:06.220   01:43:06.230  
much   in continues with the
  

01:43:06.230   01:43:08.569  
much   in continues with the
judeo-christian     but     in  

01:43:08.569   01:43:08.579  
judeo-christian morality   almost in
  

01:43:08.579   01:43:10.310  
judeo-christian morality   almost in
their     things     as  

01:43:10.310   01:43:10.320  
their overthrow through such   as
  

01:43:10.320   01:43:11.839  
their overthrow through such   as
the     Enlightenment     Scientific

the   the Scientific
Revolution     values     would  

01:43:16.430   01:43:16.440  
Revolution   would
  

01:43:16.440   01:43:20.319  
Revolution   would
never     out     the  

01:43:20.319   01:43:20.329  
never have come out   of just simply the
  

01:43:20.329   01:43:22.790  
never have come out   of just simply the
continuous     that  

01:43:22.790   01:43:22.800  
continuous of the Middle Ages and that
 

01:43:22.800   01:43:24.830  
continuous of the Middle Ages and that
judeo-christian     morality    my  

01:43:24.830   01:43:24.840  
judeo-christian morality   but my
  

01:43:24.840   01:43:27.700  
judeo-christian morality   but my 
   that  

01:43:27.700   01:43:27.710  
  understanding of your view would be that
  

01:43:27.710   01:43:30.229  
  understanding of your view would be that
those     in     the  

01:43:30.229   01:43:30.239  
those   the
  

01:43:30.239   01:43:31.759  
those   the
judeo-christian     just  

01:43:31.759   01:43:31.769  
judeo-christian morality I'm just
 

01:43:31.769   01:43:36.140  
judeo-christian morality I'm just
wondering     how    what  

01:43:36.140   01:43:36.150  
wondering how   yeah just what
  

01:43:36.150   01:43:38.180  
wondering how   yeah just what
is     around     own  

01:43:38.180   01:43:38.190  
is the   in my own
  

01:43:38.190   01:43:47.000  
is the   in my own
world    question  

01:43:47.000   01:43:47.010  
 
 

01:43:47.010   01:43:50.490  
 
they're     rational    they're  

01:43:50.490   01:43:50.500  
they're not rational   they're
  

01:43:50.500   01:43:52.470  
they're not rational   they're
deeper     rational     it  

01:43:52.470   01:43:52.480  
deeper than rational   I mean it
  

01:43:52.480   01:43:55.560  
deeper than rational   I mean it
was     meet     into  

01:43:55.560   01:43:55.570  
was a surprise   going back into
  

01:43:55.570   01:43:57.630  
was a surprise   going back into 
   these  

01:43:57.630   01:43:57.640  
  the past let's say to see how deep these
  

01:43:57.640   01:44:03.090  
  the past let's say to see how deep these
values     say     not  

01:44:03.090   01:44:03.100  
values were   that not
  

01:44:03.100   01:44:05.240  
values were   that not 
   the  

01:44:05.240   01:44:05.250  
   are they part of the
  

01:44:05.250   01:44:07.590  
   are they part of the
judeo-christian     but     that  

01:44:07.590   01:44:07.600  
judeo-christian story let's say but   that
  

01:44:07.600   01:44:10.770  
judeo-christian story let's say but   that
they're     are  

01:44:10.770   01:44:10.780  
they're grounded in phenomena that   are
  

01:44:10.780   01:44:12.750  
they're grounded in phenomena that   are
even     a  

01:44:12.750   01:44:12.760  
even   deeper than that there's been a
  

01:44:12.760   01:44:15.540  
even   deeper than that there's been a
fair     investigation     the  

01:44:15.540   01:44:15.550  
fair bit of investigation   into the
  

01:44:15.550   01:44:18.300  
fair bit of investigation   into the
emergence     among  

01:44:18.300   01:44:18.310  
emergence of   fair play let's say among
  

01:44:18.310   01:44:22.140  
emergence of   fair play let's say among
animals     wolves     so  

01:44:22.140   01:44:22.150  
animals rats   and so
  

01:44:22.150   01:44:24.950  
animals rats   and so
forth    emerges  

01:44:24.950   01:44:24.960  
forth   there's an ethos that emerges
  

01:44:24.960   01:44:27.300  
forth   there's an ethos that emerges
behaviorally     perhaps  

01:44:27.300   01:44:27.310  
behaviorally and   and is then perhaps
  

01:44:27.310   01:44:29.340  
behaviorally and   and is then perhaps
woven     codified  

01:44:29.340   01:44:29.350  
woven into narrative and then codified
 

01:44:29.350   01:44:33.300  
woven into narrative and then codified
that   these  

01:44:33.300   01:44:33.310  
that   seems to be isomorphic across these
  

01:44:33.310   01:44:35.520  
that   seems to be isomorphic across these 
   been  

01:44:35.520   01:44:35.530  
   it's been
  

01:44:35.530   01:44:38.160  
   it's been
well     sense  

01:44:38.160   01:44:38.170  
well   articulated in the narrative sense
  

01:44:38.170   01:44:40.470  
well   articulated in the narrative sense 
   stories  

01:44:40.470   01:44:40.480  
  in the judeo-christian corpus of stories
  

01:44:40.480   01:44:42.750  
  in the judeo-christian corpus of stories
and     that     legal  

01:44:42.750   01:44:42.760  
and that it's out of   our legal
  

01:44:42.760   01:44:45.180  
and that it's out of   our legal 
   rights  

01:44:45.180   01:44:45.190  
  systems and and institutions of rights
  

01:44:45.190   01:44:47.820  
  systems and and institutions of rights
have     that  

01:44:47.820   01:44:47.830  
have emerged   people make the case that
  

01:44:47.830   01:44:49.320  
have emerged   people make the case that 
   Enlightenment  

01:44:49.320   01:44:49.330  
  that was fundamentally an Enlightenment
  

01:44:49.330   01:44:52.280  
  that was fundamentally an Enlightenment 
   that  

01:44:52.280   01:44:52.290  
   case that
  

01:44:52.290   01:44:55.320  
   case that 
   along  

01:44:55.320   01:44:55.330  
  the rational clarity that came along
  

01:44:55.330   01:44:57.630  
  the rational clarity that came along 
   the  

01:44:57.630   01:44:57.640  
   the Enlightenment increased the
  

01:44:57.640   01:44:59.490  
   the Enlightenment increased the
degree     to     and  

01:44:59.490   01:44:59.500  
degree to   which that was articulated and
  

01:44:59.500   01:45:02.280  
degree to   which that was articulated and
transformed     law     to  

01:45:02.280   01:45:02.290  
transformed into law   but I think to
  

01:45:02.290   01:45:04.530  
transformed into law   but I think to 
   mistake  

01:45:04.530   01:45:04.540  
  attribute it to that is a great mistake
  

01:45:04.540   01:45:09.330  
  attribute it to that is a great mistake
I     view  

01:45:09.330   01:45:09.340  
  I think it's I think the time span view
  

01:45:09.340   01:45:12.000  
  I think it's I think the time span view
is     ago  

01:45:12.000   01:45:12.010  
is way too narrow   that's 500 years ago
  

01:45:12.010   01:45:15.300  
is way too narrow   that's 500 years ago 
   like  

01:45:15.300   01:45:15.310  
  I'm a biologically minded guy it's like
  

01:45:15.310   01:45:19.620  
  I'm a biologically minded guy it's like 
   years  

01:45:19.620   01:45:19.630  
   5,000 years
  

01:45:19.630   01:45:22.770  
   5,000 years
well     register     50,000  

01:45:22.770   01:45:22.780  
well that's starting   50,000
  

01:45:22.780   01:45:26.250  
well that's starting   50,000
years     note     million  

01:45:26.250   01:45:26.260  
years   million
  

01:45:26.260   01:45:28.020  
years   million
years     getting     somewhere  

01:45:28.020   01:45:28.030  
years now you're getting   somewhere
  

01:45:28.030   01:45:30.420  
years now you're getting   somewhere 
   discussing  

01:45:30.420   01:45:30.430  
  there's the ethic that we're discussing
  

01:45:30.430   01:45:33.720  
  there's the ethic that we're discussing
is     way     up  

01:45:33.720   01:45:33.730  
is way   deeper than something conjured up
  

01:45:33.730   01:45:37.880  
is way   deeper than something conjured up
in     Italians  

01:45:37.880   01:45:37.890  
in like 1500 by some northern Italians
 

01:45:37.890   01:45:41.370  
in like 1500 by some northern Italians
so     a 

01:45:41.370   01:45:41.380  
so it's an articulation of a
 

01:45:41.380   01:45:43.590  
so it's an articulation of a
   the  

01:45:43.590   01:45:43.600  
  substructure that's much deeper than the
  

01:45:43.600   01:45:45.660  
  substructure that's much deeper than the
articulation     looks  

01:45:45.660   01:45:45.670  
articulation itself that's what it looks
 

01:45:45.670   01:45:47.550  
articulation itself that's what it looks
like     to    for  

01:45:47.550   01:45:47.560  
like to   now I think there's room for
  

01:45:47.560   01:45:51.060  
like to   now I think there's room for
intelligent     that     I've  

01:45:51.060   01:45:51.070  
intelligent debate   but I've
  

01:45:51.070   01:45:52.860  
intelligent debate   but I've
looked     thinkers     and  

01:45:52.860   01:45:52.870  
looked at the Enlightenment thinkers   and
  

01:45:52.870   01:45:57.090  
looked at the Enlightenment thinkers   and
at     as  

01:45:57.090   01:45:57.100  
at the deeper   people who I regard as
  

01:45:57.100   01:45:58.860  
at the deeper   people who I regard as
deeper     deeper  

01:45:58.860   01:45:58.870  
deeper   and I think the deeper
  

01:45:58.870   01:46:00.960  
deeper   and I think the deeper
guys     in  

01:46:00.960   01:46:00.970  
guys Nietzsche   Dostoevsky Jung in
  

01:46:00.970   01:46:03.030  
guys Nietzsche   Dostoevsky Jung in
particular     degree  

01:46:03.030   01:46:03.040  
particular Solzhenitsyn to some degree
 

01:46:03.040   01:46:06.990  
particular Solzhenitsyn to some degree
   think  

01:46:06.990   01:46:07.000  
   so I don't think
  

01:46:07.000   01:46:08.550  
   so I don't think
it's     I     are  

01:46:08.550   01:46:08.560  
it's I   don't think that our rights are
  

01:46:08.560   01:46:10.440  
it's I   don't think that our rights are
an     project     their  

01:46:10.440   01:46:10.450  
an Enlightenment project   their
  

01:46:10.450   01:46:14.130  
an Enlightenment project   their
instantiation     law     that's  

01:46:14.130   01:46:14.140  
instantiation into codified law   that's
  

01:46:14.140   01:46:16.440  
instantiation into codified law   that's
more     Enlightenment  

01:46:16.440   01:46:16.450  
more part parcel of the   Enlightenment
  

01:46:16.450   01:46:18.420  
more part parcel of the   Enlightenment
that     manifest  

01:46:18.420   01:46:18.430  
that that would be particularly manifest
 

01:46:18.430   01:46:20.850  
that that would be particularly manifest
in     like    you  

01:46:20.850   01:46:20.860  
in a place like   States you
  

01:46:20.860   01:46:24.480  
in a place like   States you
know    a  

01:46:24.480   01:46:24.490  
know   so yeah if I can discuss have a
  

01:46:24.490   01:46:27.020  
know   so yeah if I can discuss have a 
   and

religious in stories   and religious is
something     structure  

01:57:13.380   01:57:13.390  
something like the grammatical   structure
  

01:57:13.390   01:57:15.990  
something like the grammatical   structure 
   you  

01:57:15.990   01:57:16.000  
   you
  

01:57:16.000   01:57:18.500  
   you
look     story     story  

01:57:18.500   01:57:18.510  
look at what makes a story   a story
  

01:57:18.510   01:57:22.350  
look at what makes a story   a story
that's     yeah     story  

01:57:22.350   01:57:22.360  
that's religious   it's not a story
  

01:57:22.360   01:57:24.450  
that's religious   it's not a story 
   particular  

01:57:24.450   01:57:24.460  
  otherwise like a story is a particular
  

01:57:24.460   01:57:26.880  
  otherwise like a story is a particular
sort     like     sense

sort   simple a sense
  

01:57:26.890   01:57:29.070

   get  

01:57:29.070   01:57:29.080  
  the story is an account of how to get
  

01:57:29.080   01:57:32.250  
  the story is an account of how to get
from    a

   a

otherwise     A

otherwise you   wouldn't go from point A
  

01:57:38.320   01:57:40.890  
otherwise you   wouldn't go from point A
to     means  

01:57:40.890   01:57:40.900  
to   point B so just to make the map means
  

01:57:40.900   01:57:42.690  
to   point B so just to make the map means
to     but  

01:57:42.690   01:57:42.700  
to adopt a value structure   but there but
  

01:57:42.700   01:57:43.950  
to adopt a value structure   but there but 
   complicated  

01:57:43.950   01:57:43.960  
  the story is actually more complicated

  think the reason they they tend to

01:58:09.030   01:58:09.040  
   because it

the finite   and comprehensible and the
infinite     uncomprehensible     like  

01:58:15.780   01:58:15.790  
infinite and uncomprehensible   it's like
  

01:58:15.790   01:58:17.790  
infinite and uncomprehensible   it's like
we     the     comprehensible

we live in the   finite and comprehensible

we live in the   finite and comprehensible 
   and  

01:58:19.680   01:58:19.690  
   we're surrounded by the infinite and
  

01:58:19.690   01:58:21.420  
   we're surrounded by the infinite and
incomprehensible    a

incomprehensible   a

01:58:26.020   01:58:28.290  
mediating border   and art
that's     religion     and  

01:58:28.290   01:58:28.300  
that's narrative that's   and
  

01:58:28.300   01:58:31.590  
that's narrative that's   and
it's     metaphorical  

01:58:31.590   01:58:31.600  
it's that   it's that strange metaphorical
  

01:58:31.600   01:58:34.620  
it's that   it's that strange metaphorical
reality     not     and  

01:58:34.620   01:58:34.630  
reality let's say that's   and

it's     not  

01:58:37.170   01:58:37.180  
it's not comprehensible   but that's not
  

01:58:37.180   01:58:39.480  
it's not comprehensible   but that's not
infinitely     incomprehensible     it's  

01:58:39.480   01:58:39.490  
infinitely incomprehensible   either it's
  

01:58:39.490   01:58:43.080  
infinitely incomprehensible   either it's
a     between     you  

01:58:43.080   01:58:43.090  
a bridge between   the two so and as you
  

01:58:43.090   01:58:45.180  
a bridge between   the two so and as you
move     the     and  

01:58:45.180   01:58:45.190  
move closer to the   infinite and
  

01:58:45.190   01:58:48.300  
move closer to the   infinite and 
   you  

01:58:48.300   01:58:48.310  
   that bridge you
  

01:58:48.310   01:58:50.340  
   that bridge you
get     what  

01:58:50.340   01:58:50.350  
get farther and   farther away from what
  

01:58:50.350   01:58:52.590  
get farther and   farther away from what
you     it     be

exactly
I     lot    young  

01:59:13.800   01:59:13.810  
I learned a lot   young
  

01:59:13.810   01:59:16.050  
I learned a lot   young
because    that  

01:59:16.050   01:59:16.060  
because   that
  

01:59:16.060   01:59:19.380  
because   that
rationality    like  

01:59:19.380   01:59:19.390  
rationality   is embedded in a dream like
  

01:59:19.390   01:59:21.120  
rationality   is embedded in a dream like
there's     then  

01:59:21.120   01:59:21.130  
there's the infinite unknowable and then
 

01:59:21.130   01:59:23.760  
there's the infinite unknowable and then
there's     the    the  

01:59:23.760   01:59:23.770  
there's the   dream and then inside the
  

01:59:23.770   01:59:25.860  
there's the   dream and then inside the
dream     I  

01:59:25.860   01:59:25.870  
dream is   the rational domain and I
  

01:59:25.870   01:59:28.440  
dream is   the rational domain and I 
   else  

01:59:28.440   01:59:28.450  
   that to be the case why else
  

01:59:28.450   01:59:31.890  
   that to be the case why else 
   dream  

01:59:31.890   01:59:31.900  
   have to dream
  

01:59:31.900   01:59:35.100  
   have to dream
if     insane     it  

01:59:35.100   01:59:35.110  
if we don't dream we we go insane   it
  

01:59:35.110   01:59:37.530  
if we don't dream we we go insane   it
doesn't     there's  

01:59:37.530   01:59:37.540  
doesn't take very long   and so there's
  

01:59:37.540   01:59:42.020  
doesn't take very long   and so there's
there's     poetic  

01:59:42.020   01:59:42.030  
 
 

01:59:42.030   01:59:45.000  
 
conceptualization     it 

01:59:45.000   01:59:45.010  
conceptualization that grounds us and it
 

01:59:45.010   01:59:47.580  
conceptualization that grounds us and it
has     to    them  

01:59:47.580   01:59:47.590  
has to   you know them
  

01:59:47.590   01:59:50.550  
has to   you know them 
   think  

01:59:50.550   01:59:50.560  
   think
  

01:59:50.560   01:59:52.830  
   think
about     activity  

01:59:52.830   01:59:52.840  
about them as random neural activity
 

01:59:52.840   01:59:55.080  
about them as random neural activity
it's     there's    you  

01:59:55.080   01:59:55.090  
it's like there's   nothing right when you
  

01:59:55.090   01:59:58.110  
it's like there's   nothing right when you
look     a  

01:59:58.110   01:59:58.120  
look at a TV screen   that's not on a
  

01:59:58.120   02:00:02.010  
look at a TV screen   that's not on a
channel     dream  

02:00:02.010   02:00:02.020  
channel that's random   when you dream
  

02:00:02.020   02:00:04.040  
channel that's random   when you dream
something     sophisticated  

02:00:04.040   02:00:04.050  
something complex and   sophisticated
  

02:00:04.050   02:00:10.710  
something complex and   sophisticated 
   the  

02:00:10.710   02:00:10.720  
  that's not random so yeah so the
  

02:00:10.720   02:00:13.230  
  that's not random so yeah so the
metaphor     say     we  

02:00:13.230   02:00:13.240  
metaphor surrounds us let's say   and we
  

02:00:13.240   02:00:14.730  
metaphor surrounds us let's say   and we
can    can  

02:00:14.730   02:00:14.740  
can   it rationally and we can
  

02:00:14.740   02:00:16.410  
can   it rationally and we can
undermine     in

mother agenda that you might   attribute
to     multivariate  

02:01:14.860   02:01:14.870  
to radical leftists it's a multivariate
 

02:01:14.870   02:01:17.380  
to radical leftists it's a multivariate
problem     right 

02:01:17.380   02:01:17.390  
problem right
 

02:01:17.390   02:01:20.050  
problem right
like     society    biases  

02:01:20.050   02:01:20.060  
like no society   its biases
  

02:01:20.060   02:01:22.690  
like no society   its biases
and     get  

02:01:22.690   02:01:22.700  
and prejudices   and some of them get
  

02:01:22.700   02:01:25.110  
and prejudices   and some of them get
built     into     and  

02:01:25.110   02:01:25.120  
built into   the system's themselves and
  

02:01:25.120   02:01:28.420  
built into   the system's themselves and
so     you     and  

02:01:28.420   02:01:28.430  
so when you   look at unequal outcomes and
  

02:01:28.430   02:01:29.950  
so when you   look at unequal outcomes and
you're     those

you're trying to   discover why those
  

02:01:29.960   02:01:32.380  
you're trying to   discover why those
unequal     any  

02:01:32.380   02:01:32.390  
unequal outcomes exist   if you have any
  

02:01:32.390   02:01:34.270  
unequal outcomes exist   if you have any
sense     multivariate  

02:01:34.270   02:01:34.280  
sense then   you do a multivariate
  

02:01:34.280   02:01:36.730  
sense then   you do a multivariate
analysis     prejudice     and  

02:01:36.730   02:01:36.740  
analysis and you put in prejudice   and
  

02:01:36.740   02:01:39.610  
analysis and you put in prejudice   and
discrimination     factors     one

   radical  

02:01:46.090   02:01:46.100  
   with the problem with the radical
  

02:01:46.100   02:01:48.610  
   with the problem with the radical
leftist     that  

02:01:48.610   02:01:48.620  
  leftist is that they take the fact that
  

02:01:48.620   02:01:50.920  
  leftist is that they take the fact that
societal     to  

02:01:50.920   02:01:50.930  
societal structures are tyrannical to
 

02:01:50.930   02:01:52.600  
societal structures are tyrannical to
some     arbitrary    course  

02:01:52.600   02:01:52.610  
some degree in arbitrary   which of course
  

02:01:52.610   02:01:54.460  
some degree in arbitrary   which of course 
   and  

02:01:54.460   02:01:54.470  
  they are because they're imperfect and
  

02:01:54.470   02:01:57.700  
  they are because they're imperfect and
then     the  

02:01:57.700   02:01:57.710  
then they obliterate the rest of the
 

02:01:57.710   02:02:01.090  
then they obliterate the rest of the
complexity     there's 

02:02:01.090   02:02:01.100  
complexity with that claim so there's
 

02:02:01.100   02:02:04.660  
complexity with that claim so there's
lots     reasons    systemic  

02:02:04.660   02:02:04.670  
lots of reasons   systemic
  

02:02:04.670   02:02:08.260  
lots of reasons   systemic
bias     open  

02:02:08.260   02:02:08.270  
bias is one of them   to what it's an open
  

02:02:08.270   02:02:10.390  
bias is one of them   to what it's an open
question     bias  

02:02:10.390   02:02:10.400  
question   to what degree systemic bias
  

02:02:10.400   02:02:14.410  
question   to what degree systemic bias
plays     let's  

02:02:14.410   02:02:14.420  
plays in in the inequality problem let's
 

02:02:14.420   02:02:16.540  
plays in in the inequality problem let's
   could  

02:02:16.540   02:02:16.550  
   that we could
  

02:02:16.550   02:02:18.850  
   that we could
hypothetically    certain  

02:02:18.850   02:02:18.860  
hypothetically   address with a certain
  

02:02:18.860   02:02:21.340  
hypothetically   address with a certain
degree     intelligence  

02:02:21.340   02:02:21.350  
degree of   detachment and intelligence
  

02:02:21.350   02:02:26.050  
degree of   detachment and intelligence
so     and  

02:02:26.050   02:02:26.060  
so no system is perfect   not and
  

02:02:26.060   02:02:30.399  
so no system is perfect   not and
certainly     us  

02:02:30.399   02:02:30.409  
 
 

02:02:30.409   02:02:35.509  
 
reasonable     answer    that's  

02:02:35.509   02:02:35.519  
reasonable reasonable answer   okay that's
  

02:02:35.519   02:02:41.419  
reasonable reasonable answer   okay that's
that's     it's  

02:02:41.419   02:02:41.429  
that's wise   all right so I think it's
  

02:02:41.429   02:02:44.329  
that's wise   all right so I think it's
safe     to     of  

02:02:44.329   02:02:44.339  
safe to   of
  

02:02:44.339   02:02:46.369  
safe to   of
post-modernism    where  

02:02:46.369   02:02:46.379  
post-modernism   there are times where
  

02:02:46.379   02:02:48.259  
post-modernism   there are times where
I     fair

I   don't think you quite give it a fair

but if you could point   to one or two of

reason I can't read it   is because it 
   I've

02:04:09.500   02:04:09.510  
   and I understand the post
  

02:04:09.510   02:04:12.289  
   and I understand the post

02:04:12.289   02:04:12.299  
modernist   viewpoint like look it is the
  

02:04:12.299   02:04:15.019  
modernist   viewpoint like look it is the
case     set     is

okay     that's    nutshell  

02:04:19.279   02:04:19.289  
okay that's   post modernism in a nutshell
  

02:04:19.289   02:04:21.199  
okay that's   post modernism in a nutshell 
   like  

02:04:21.199   02:04:21.209  
   and like
  

02:04:21.209   02:04:24.019  
   and like 
   1992  

02:04:24.019   02:04:24.029  
  from 1960 to 1992
  

02:04:24.029   02:04:25.639  
  from 1960 to 1992
it     to     through  

02:04:25.639   02:04:25.649

otherwise     it's  

02:15:28.490   02:15:28.500  
  otherwise they wouldn't be open but it's
  

02:15:28.500   02:15:30.560  
  otherwise they wouldn't be open but it's
hard     that     and  

02:15:30.560   02:15:30.570  
hard   be orderly and
  

02:15:30.570   02:15:32.600  
hard   be orderly and
conscientious     and  

02:15:32.600   02:15:32.610  
conscientious and   so and and
  

02:15:32.610   02:15:34.220  
conscientious and   so and and
corporations     tension  

02:15:34.220   02:15:34.230  
corporations suffer from this tension
 

02:15:34.230   02:15:35.540  
corporations suffer from this tension
   they're  

02:15:35.540   02:15:35.550  
   because they're
  

02:15:35.550   02:15:39.290  
   because they're
started     get  

02:15:39.290   02:15:39.300  
started by open people but when they get
 

02:15:39.300   02:15:41.570  
started by open people but when they get
going   run  

02:15:41.570   02:15:41.580  
going   algorithm eyes they're run
  

02:15:41.580   02:15:43.340  
going   algorithm eyes they're run
by     people     the  

02:15:43.340   02:15:43.350  
by conscientious people   but then the
  

02:15:43.350   02:15:44.660  
by conscientious people   but then the
conscientious     down  

02:15:44.660   02:15:44.670  
conscientious people   can only go down
  

02:15:44.670   02:15:46.280  
conscientious people   can only go down 
   environment  

02:15:46.280   02:15:46.290  
  one track and if the environment
  

02:15:46.290   02:15:47.990  
  one track and if the environment 
   disappears  

02:15:47.990   02:15:48.000  
  transforms the whole company disappears
  

02:15:48.000   02:15:50.960  
  transforms the whole company disappears 
   the  

02:15:50.960   02:15:50.970  
  so I would say you take a look at the
  

02:15:50.970   02:15:53.450  
  so I would say you take a look at the
conscientiousness     you  

02:15:53.450   02:15:53.460  
conscientiousness score   you see if you
  

02:15:53.460   02:15:54.620  
conscientiousness score   you see if you
can     discipline  

02:15:54.620   02:15:54.630  
can figure out how   to discipline
  

02:15:54.630   02:15:56.750  
can figure out how   to discipline 
   can  

02:15:56.750   02:15:56.760  
  yourself a bit more and see if you can
  

02:15:56.760   02:15:58.820  
  yourself a bit more and see if you can
figure     schedule     not  

02:15:58.820   02:15:58.830  
figure out how   your time not
  

02:15:58.830   02:16:00.620  
figure out how   your time not
like     like     a  

02:16:00.620   02:16:00.630  
like a prison but like   a like a

like a prison but like   a like a
structured     then  

02:16:02.840   02:16:02.850  
structured set of opportunities   and then
  

02:16:02.850   02:16:05.210  
structured set of opportunities   and then
you     understand     be  

02:16:05.210   02:16:05.220  
you understand   to be
  

02:16:05.220   02:16:07.610  
you understand   to be
successful    medium  

02:16:07.610   02:16:07.620  
successful   life likely in the medium
  

02:16:07.620   02:16:09.860  
successful   life likely in the medium
to     going     find  

02:16:09.860   02:16:09.870  
to long run you're going   to have to find
  

02:16:09.870   02:16:12.080  
to long run you're going   to have to find 
   it  

02:16:12.080   02:16:12.090  
   to you it
  

02:16:12.090   02:16:13.850  
   to you it
could     be     whatever  

02:16:13.850   02:16:13.860  
could   partners or whatever
  

02:16:13.860   02:16:16.180  
could   partners or whatever
that     missing  

02:16:16.180   02:16:16.190  
that fill in that missing
 

02:16:16.190   02:16:19.190  
that fill in that missing
conscientiousness     the 

02:16:19.190   02:16:19.200  
conscientiousness gap so I guess the
 

02:16:19.200   02:16:21.080  
conscientiousness gap so I guess the
   been  

02:16:21.080   02:16:21.090  
  Part B was my boyfriend we've been
  

02:16:21.090   02:16:22.490  
  Part B was my boyfriend we've been
together     a     we're  

02:16:22.490   02:16:22.500  
together for a   very long time and we're
  

02:16:22.500   02:16:24.740  
together for a   very long time and we're 
   in  

02:16:24.740   02:16:24.750  
   very high in
  

02:16:24.750   02:16:26.480  
   very high in
neuroticism     and     like  

02:16:26.480   02:16:26.490  
neuroticism and   that's where like
  

02:16:26.490   02:16:28.040  
neuroticism and   that's where like
our     as  

02:16:28.040   02:16:28.050  
  our conflict comes and as far as
  

02:16:28.050   02:16:30.500  
  our conflict comes and as far as
long-term     things     you  

02:16:30.500   02:16:30.510  
long-term   that you
  

02:16:30.510   02:16:34.070  
long-term   that you
know    neurotic  

02:16:34.070   02:16:34.080  
know   lowly conscientious and neurotic
  

02:16:34.080   02:16:38.639  
know   lowly conscientious and neurotic
[Laughter] 

02:16:38.639   02:16:38.649  
[Laughter]
 

02:16:38.649   02:16:42.759  
[Laughter]
   mean  

02:16:42.759   02:16:42.769  
  we'll look into that yeah well I mean
  

02:16:42.769   02:16:47.200  
  we'll look into that yeah well I mean
the    levels  

02:16:47.200   02:16:47.210  
   simple I can only its it high levels
  

02:16:47.210   02:16:49.750  
   simple I can only its it high levels 
   a  

02:16:49.750   02:16:49.760  
  of neuroticism are problematic in a
  

02:16:49.760   02:16:50.620  
  of neuroticism are problematic in a
relationship 

02:16:50.620   02:16:50.630  
relationship
 

02:16:50.630   02:16:54.459  
relationship
it's     why    are  

02:16:54.459   02:16:54.469  
it's probably why   75% of divorces are
  

02:16:54.469   02:16:57.009  
it's probably why   75% of divorces are
initiated     by     are  

02:16:57.009   02:16:57.019  
initiated by   women because women are
  

02:16:57.019   02:16:59.019  
initiated by   women because women are
higher     men     I  

02:16:59.019   02:16:59.029  
higher in their   and I
  

02:16:59.029   02:17:00.519  
higher in their   and I 
   they  

02:17:00.519   02:17:00.529  
   that is that they
  

02:17:00.529   02:17:02.259  
   that is that they
have     more     infant  

02:17:02.259   02:17:02.269  
have to be more   sensitive to infant
  

02:17:02.269   02:17:04.299  
have to be more   sensitive to infant
distress     more  

02:17:04.299   02:17:04.309  
distress   and so that makes them more
  

02:17:04.309   02:17:06.309  
distress   and so that makes them more 
   I  

02:17:06.309   02:17:06.319  
   distress in general now I
  

02:17:06.319   02:17:07.719  
   distress in general now I
don't     for     sure  

02:17:07.719   02:17:07.729  
don't   sure
  

02:17:07.729   02:17:10.179  
don't   sure
it's     of  

02:17:10.179   02:17:10.189  
it's a supposition   but high levels of
  

02:17:10.189   02:17:11.620  
it's a supposition   but high levels of
neuroticism     tend     a  

02:17:11.620   02:17:11.630  
neuroticism do tend   to make a
  

02:17:11.630   02:17:14.679  
neuroticism do tend   to make a
relationship     volatile     put  

02:17:14.679   02:17:14.689  
relationship volatile   and and and to put
  

02:17:14.689   02:17:16.149  
relationship volatile   and and and to put
a     of     it  

02:17:16.149   02:17:16.159  
a fair bit of   negative emotion into it
  

02:17:16.159   02:17:19.179  
a fair bit of   negative emotion into it 
   the  

02:17:19.179   02:17:19.189  
  now the question is where what the
  

02:17:19.189   02:17:21.099  
  now the question is where what the
source     neuroticism  

02:17:21.099   02:17:21.109  
source of   the high level of neuroticism
  

02:17:21.109   02:17:23.169  
source of   the high level of neuroticism
is     be     but  

02:17:23.169   02:17:23.179  
is it might be   purely temperamental but
  

02:17:23.179   02:17:24.729  
is it might be   purely temperamental but 
   an  

02:17:24.729   02:17:24.739  
   an
  

02:17:24.739   02:17:26.410  
   an
underlying     depression  

02:17:26.410   02:17:26.420  
  underlying anxiety disorder depression
  

02:17:26.420   02:17:29.530  
  underlying anxiety disorder depression
or     because  

02:17:29.530   02:17:29.540  
or or a physiological   problem because
  

02:17:29.540   02:17:30.939  
or or a physiological   problem because
they     high  

02:17:30.939   02:17:30.949  
they can manifest themselves in high
 

02:17:30.949   02:17:32.439  
they can manifest themselves in high
levels     emotion    so  

02:17:32.439   02:17:32.449  
levels of negative emotion   and so
  

02:17:32.449   02:17:35.080  
levels of negative emotion   and so
there's     doing  

02:17:35.080   02:17:35.090  
there's always the possibility of doing

there's always the possibility of doing

   stuck to their notes because of it
but     much  

02:19:43.600   02:19:43.610  
but   you want to know ten times as much
  

02:19:43.610   02:19:45.640  
but   you want to know ten times as much
as     you     and

as you   and
then     path  

02:19:48.640   02:19:48.650  
then   you can specify a stepping path
  

02:19:48.650   02:19:50.980  
then   you can specify a stepping path

have   because
  

02:19:56.061   02:19:57.791  
have   because
that's     where

that's where the   synthesize that's where

that's where the   synthesize that's where
the     the

the synthesizing comes so that's on the

   techniques  

02:20:05.381   02:20:05.391  
  well there's some tricks techniques
  

02:20:05.391   02:20:07.751  
  well there's some tricks techniques 
   in  

02:20:07.751   02:20:07.761  
  let's say is like if you're speaking in
  

02:20:07.761   02:20:10.421  
  let's say is like if you're speaking in 
   delivering  

02:20:10.421   02:20:10.431  
  front of a group you are not delivering
  

02:20:10.431   02:20:13.871  
  front of a group you are not delivering
a     a     you're  

02:20:13.871   02:20:13.881  
a talk   not what you're
  

02:20:13.881   02:20:15.671  
a talk   not what you're
doing     thing  

02:20:15.671   02:20:15.681  
doing the talk   isn't a package thing
  

02:20:15.681   02:20:18.461  
doing the talk   isn't a package thing
that     to     isn't  

02:20:18.461   02:20:18.471  
that you   a group there isn't
  

02:20:18.471   02:20:21.161  
that you   a group there isn't
a     individuals  

02:20:21.161   02:20:21.171  
a group there's a bunch of individuals
 

02:20:21.171   02:20:24.100  
a group there's a bunch of individuals
   a  

02:20:24.100   02:20:24.110  
   a
  

02:20:24.110   02:20:26.261  
   a
group    a  

02:20:26.261   02:20:26.271  
group   one at a
  

02:20:26.271   02:20:28.301  
group   one at a
time     because  

02:20:28.301   02:20:28.311  
time   and that makes it easier to because
  

02:20:28.311   02:20:30.310  
time   and that makes it easier to because
you     to     it's  

02:20:30.310   02:20:30.320  
you know how to   person it's
  

02:20:30.320   02:20:31.781  
you know how to   person it's
like     can     people  

02:20:31.781   02:20:31.791  
like   you talk to a thousand people
  

02:20:31.791   02:20:33.100  
like   you talk to a thousand people
well    too  

02:20:33.100   02:20:33.110  
well   probably not because it's too
  

02:20:33.110   02:20:35.320  
well   probably not because it's too
intimidating     thousand  

02:20:35.320   02:20:35.330  
intimidating   but there isn't a thousand
  

02:20:35.330   02:20:38.770  
intimidating   but there isn't a thousand 
   thousand  

02:20:38.770   02:20:38.780  
   there there's a thousand
  

02:20:38.780   02:20:40.390  
   there there's a thousand
individuals     an  

02:20:40.390   02:20:40.400  
individuals   and so you just look at an
  

02:20:40.400   02:20:42.251  
individuals   and so you just look at an
individual     something     you  

02:20:42.251   02:20:42.261  
individual and   and you
  

02:20:42.261   02:20:45.671  
individual and   and you 
   look  

02:20:45.671   02:20:45.681  
  can tell if they're engaged they look
  

02:20:45.681   02:20:47.591  
  can tell if they're engaged they look 
   they  

02:20:47.591   02:20:47.601  
  confused or they look interested or they
  

02:20:47.601   02:20:49.751  
  confused or they look interested or they
look     maybe  

02:20:49.751   02:20:49.761  
look   angry or they look bored or maybe
  

02:20:49.761   02:20:51.281  
look   angry or they look bored or maybe
they're    at  

02:20:51.281   02:20:51.291  
they're   asleep in which case you look at
  

02:20:51.291   02:20:54.100  
they're   asleep in which case you look at
someone     else     feedback  

02:20:54.100   02:20:54.110  
someone else   and they give you feedback
  

02:20:54.110   02:20:56.591  
someone else   and they give you feedback
about    thing  

02:20:56.591   02:20:56.601  
about   thing

is to   yeah but
the     pay  

02:21:01.710   02:21:01.720  
the next   thing is pay
  

02:21:01.720   02:21:03.059  
the next   thing is pay
attention     to  

02:21:03.059   02:21:03.069

and shifting position and you know
 

02:21:44.229   02:21:47.519  
and shifting position and you know
   can  

02:21:47.519   02:21:47.529  
  looking like this or and you can you can
  

02:21:47.529   02:21:50.340  
  looking like this or and you can you can 
   to  

02:21:50.340   02:21:50.350  
  pull that in and and and use it to
  

02:21:50.350   02:21:52.620

   will undo you
psychologically     high     you  

02:37:35.621   02:37:35.631  
psychologically is very very high   so you
  

02:37:35.631   02:37:37.961  
psychologically is very very high   so you
have     the  

02:37:37.961   02:37:37.971  
have to be wise as serpents that's the
 

02:37:37.971   02:37:39.491  
have to be wise as serpents that's the
old     saying    a

02:37:50.851   02:37:53.190  
 
maybe     because    I'm  

02:37:53.190   02:37:53.200  
maybe we'll do two more because   I'm
  

02:37:53.200   02:37:55.171  
maybe we'll do two more because   I'm
starting     I've  

02:37:55.171   02:37:55.181  
starting to get fuzzy minded and I've
 

02:37:55.181   02:37:59.520  
starting to get fuzzy minded and I've
learned     point    so  

02:37:59.520   02:37:59.530  
learned to quit at that point   mostly so
  

02:37:59.530   02:38:02.220  
learned to quit at that point   mostly so
we     you  

02:38:02.220   02:38:02.230  
we talked a bit   before yeah before you
  

02:38:02.230   02:38:04.140  
we talked a bit   before yeah before you
started     phrase  

02:38:04.140   02:38:04.150  
started   don't know exactly how to phrase
  

02:38:04.150   02:38:06.511  
started   don't know exactly how to phrase
this     like  

02:38:06.511   02:38:06.521  
this   and I think that this will be like
  

02:38:06.521   02:38:08.280  
this   and I think that this will be like
I     all  

02:38:08.280   02:38:08.290  
I do want to like acknowledge that all
 

02:38:08.290   02:38:09.961  
I do want to like acknowledge that all
of     this    it's  

02:38:09.961   02:38:09.971  
of this   because it's
  

02:38:09.971   02:38:11.881  
of this   because it's
basically     with  

02:38:11.881   02:38:11.891  
basically been a   lecturer mixed with
  

02:38:11.891   02:38:14.370  
basically been a   lecturer mixed with
reality    combination  

02:38:14.370   02:38:14.380  
reality   and that's a good combination
  

02:38:14.380   02:38:17.730  
reality   and that's a good combination
yeah     I     don't  

02:38:17.730   02:38:17.740  
yeah it's a good combination   don't
  

02:38:17.740   02:38:20.011  
yeah it's a good combination   don't
think     actually  

02:38:20.011   02:38:20.021  
  think many speakers I go to actually
  

02:38:20.021   02:38:21.961  
  think many speakers I go to actually
know     how     did  

02:38:21.961   02:38:21.971  
know how   to combine that the way you did
  

02:38:21.971   02:38:25.350  
know how   to combine that the way you did
so     guess  

02:38:25.350   02:38:25.360  
so thank   you for that but uh I guess
  

02:38:25.360   02:38:26.700  
so thank   you for that but uh I guess
this     departure  

02:38:26.700   02:38:26.710  
this question   is a bit of a departure
  

02:38:26.710   02:38:29.001  
this question   is a bit of a departure
from     of     to  

02:38:29.001   02:38:29.011  
from   to
  

02:38:29.011   02:38:32.280  
from   to
something     of     think  

02:38:32.280   02:38:32.290  
something   don't think
  

02:38:32.290   02:38:34.950  
something   don't think 
   in  

02:38:34.950   02:38:34.960  
  everyone can relate to because it's in
  

02:38:34.960   02:38:36.841  
  everyone can relate to because it's in 
   think  

02:38:36.841   02:38:36.851  
   think
  

02:38:36.851   02:38:39.841  
   think
that     I've  

02:38:39.841   02:38:39.851  
that   after living 21 short years I've
  

02:38:39.851   02:38:41.041  
that   after living 21 short years I've
learned     way  

02:38:41.041   02:38:41.051  
learned   that the hard way
  

02:38:41.051   02:38:44.430  
learned   that the hard way
but     life  

02:38:44.430   02:38:44.440  
but you and   your life and me and my life
  

02:38:44.440   02:38:48.511  
but you and   your life and me and my life
I     both     we've  

02:38:48.511   02:38:48.521  
I feel   a moment where we've
  

02:38:48.521   02:38:51.421  
I feel   a moment where we've
had     alienating  

02:38:51.421   02:38:51.431  
had to confront   a sope alienating
  

02:38:51.431   02:38:54.120  
had to confront   a sope alienating
instance     nature     no  

02:38:54.120   02:38:54.130  
instance of nature   where there is no
  

02:38:54.130   02:38:56.370  
instance of nature   where there is no
path     forward     our  

02:38:56.370   02:38:56.380  
path forward   that we really have at our
  

02:38:56.380   02:39:01.051  
path forward   that we really have at our
disposal    an  

02:39:01.051   02:39:01.061  
disposal   and there's a point where an
  

02:39:01.061   02:39:02.640  
disposal   and there's a point where an
unnatural     come  

02:39:02.640   02:39:02.650  
unnatural amount of growth had to come
 

02:39:02.650   02:39:05.011  
unnatural amount of growth had to come
   where  

02:39:05.011   02:39:05.021  
   us so I just wanted to know where
  

02:39:05.021   02:39:08.310

02:39:08.320   02:39:10.680  
you   drew that line at your own ability
to     you  

02:39:10.680   02:39:10.690  
to   develop as a person to where you
  

02:39:10.690   02:39:12.230  
to   develop as a person to where you
didn't     become     with  

02:39:12.230   02:39:12.240  
didn't become   tunnel visioned with
  

02:39:12.240   02:39:15.570  
didn't become   tunnel visioned with
trying     to     your  

02:39:15.570   02:39:15.580  
trying to   face life's problems on your

   earth okay well we had talked just
  

02:39:17.620   02:39:19.831  
   earth okay well we had talked just 
   Q&amp;A  

02:39:19.831   02:39:19.841  
   Q&amp;A
  

02:39:19.841   02:39:21.961  
   Q&amp;A

   his 
   the  

02:39:25.470   02:39:25.480  
   too so that's kind of the
  

02:39:25.480   02:39:27.211  
   too so that's kind of the
background    part  

02:39:27.211   02:39:27.221  
background   well the first part
  

02:39:27.221   02:39:32.240  
background   well the first part 
   be  

02:39:32.240   02:39:32.250  
   be
  

02:39:32.250   02:39:34.680  
   be
pessimistically     this  

02:39:34.680   02:39:34.690  
pessimistically realistic about all this
 

02:39:34.690   02:39:39.530  
pessimistically realistic about all this
I     say    truth  

02:39:39.530   02:39:39.540  
I would say   truth
  

02:39:39.540   02:39:41.910  
I would say   truth
but     that's  

02:39:41.910   02:39:41.920  
  but that doesn't necessarily mean that's
  

02:39:41.920   02:39:44.341  
  but that doesn't necessarily mean that's 
   I  

02:39:44.341   02:39:44.351  
   I
  

02:39:44.351   02:39:47.251  
   I 
   and  

02:39:47.251   02:39:47.261  
  mean sometimes you go fight a dragon and
  

02:39:47.261   02:39:51.120  
  mean sometimes you go fight a dragon and
it     being  

02:39:51.120   02:39:51.130  
  it eats you and if the if you being
  

02:39:51.130   02:39:53.970  
  it eats you and if the if you being
eaten     possibility     it  

02:39:53.970   02:39:53.980  
eaten wasn't a real possibility   it
  

02:39:53.980   02:39:56.610  
eaten wasn't a real possibility   it
wouldn't     fight     see

  that you're confronting is going to turn
into     only     very  

02:41:38.590   02:41:38.600  
into   tragedy but something very
  

02:41:38.600   02:41:41.559  
into   tragedy but something very
much     to     be  

02:41:41.559   02:41:41.569  
much akin to   and so you might be

but what I observed was   bonds
  

02:42:56.759   02:42:58.699  
but what I observed was   bonds
were     and  

02:42:58.699   02:42:58.709  
were strengthened as a consequence   and
  

02:42:58.709   02:43:01.369

  squabbling about everything while she
was     real  

02:43:11.989   02:43:11.999  
was dying because   that's a real
  

02:43:11.999   02:43:14.139  
was dying because   that's a real
possibility     that  

02:43:14.139   02:43:14.149  
possibility and people certainly do that
 

02:43:14.149   02:43:19.750  
possibility and people certainly do that

02:43:33.551   02:43:33.561  
   going to my mind in this discussion
  

02:43:33.561   02:43:36.570  
   going to my mind in this discussion 
   videos  

02:43:36.570   02:43:36.580  
   one of our videos
  

02:43:36.580   02:43:38.290  
   one of our videos 
   interesting  

02:43:38.290   02:43:38.300  
  personally one of the most interesting
  

02:43:38.300   02:43:40.841  
  personally one of the most interesting 
   is

  aspects of neuroscience to me is
  

02:43:40.851   02:43:42.400  
  aspects of neuroscience to me is
neuroplasticity    brain's  

02:43:42.400   02:43:42.410  
neuroplasticity   when the brain's
  

02:43:42.410   02:43:45.850  
neuroplasticity   when the brain's

think that a   dynamic issue and your 
   arguments  

02:43:50.350   02:43:50.360  
  talks and you know that your arguments
  

02:43:50.360   02:43:53.921  
  talks and you know that your arguments
is    on  

02:43:53.921   02:43:53.931  
is   on the left and on
  

02:43:53.931   02:43:57.700  
is   on the left and on 
   these  

02:43:57.700   02:43:57.710  
   by it all these
  

02:43:57.710   02:43:59.591  
   by it all these
five     points     densely  

02:43:59.591   02:43:59.601  
five key points   that whole densely
  

02:43:59.601   02:44:02.671  
five key points   that whole densely 
   and  

02:44:02.671   02:44:02.681  
   there and
  

02:44:02.681   02:44:05.230  
   there and
they     maybe  

02:44:05.230   02:44:05.240  
they don't   really understand that maybe
  

02:44:05.240   02:44:08.080  
they don't   really understand that maybe
to     big  

02:44:08.080   02:44:08.090  
to the   level that they should but big
  

02:44:08.090   02:44:11.710  
to the   level that they should but big 
   is  

02:44:11.710   02:44:11.720  
  klutz I'm right and so my opinion is
  

02:44:11.720   02:44:14.591  
  klutz I'm right and so my opinion is
that     that     a

that that   bit of a

that that   bit of a 
   wired  

02:44:17.020   02:44:17.030  
   you know we are wired
  

02:44:17.030   02:44:20.110  
   you know we are wired
we're     adapt  

02:44:20.110   02:44:20.120  
we're hardwired essentially   from adapt
  

02:44:20.120   02:44:23.080  
we're hardwired essentially   from adapt
to     ourselves  

02:44:23.080   02:44:23.090  
to change   we're able to change ourselves
  

02:44:23.090   02:44:24.970  
to change   we're able to change ourselves

   you

   you
know     stay

   know  

02:44:38.051   02:44:38.061  
   explain you know
  

02:44:38.061   02:44:40.631  
   explain you know
what     you  

02:44:40.631   02:44:40.641  
what aspects of   local phenomena or you
  

02:44:40.641   02:44:43.301  
what aspects of   local phenomena or you
know     so  

02:44:43.301   02:44:43.311  
know just   social discourse what is so
  

02:44:43.311   02:44:44.650  
know just   social discourse what is so
powerful     that     overcomes  

02:44:44.650   02:44:44.660  
powerful about that that   overcomes
  

02:44:44.660   02:44:48.210  
powerful about that that   overcomes 
   it  

02:44:48.210   02:44:48.220  
   to it
  

02:44:48.220   02:44:54.060  
   to it
well     especially     it's  

02:44:54.060   02:44:54.070  
well changes changes especially   if it's
  

02:44:54.070   02:44:56.770  
well changes changes especially   if it's
the     change  

02:44:56.770   02:44:56.780  
the more radical the necessary change
 

02:44:56.780   02:44:59.110  
the more radical the necessary change
the   like  

02:44:59.110   02:44:59.120  
the   accompanies it like
  

02:44:59.120   02:45:01.810  
the   accompanies it like
the     a  

02:45:01.810   02:45:01.820  
the more opportunity as well but and a
 

02:45:01.820   02:45:03.700  
the more opportunity as well but and a
lot     of    painfully  

02:45:03.700   02:45:03.710  
lot of   what we learn we learn painfully
  

02:45:03.710   02:45:05.560  
lot of   what we learn we learn painfully 
   people  

02:45:05.560   02:45:05.570  
  and so it's not surprising that people
  

02:45:05.570   02:45:07.900  
  and so it's not surprising that people 
   in  

02:45:07.900   02:45:07.910  
   we learn in
  

02:45:07.910   02:45:10.120  
   we learn in
pain     frequently  

02:45:10.120   02:45:10.130  
pain and   anxiety very frequently
  

02:45:10.130   02:45:12.131  
pain and   anxiety very frequently
everyone     that  

02:45:12.131   02:45:12.141  
everyone knows that   like the things that
  

02:45:12.141   02:45:13.900  
everyone knows that   like the things that 
   life  

02:45:13.900   02:45:13.910  
  really that you really learned in life
  

02:45:13.910   02:45:16.511  
  really that you really learned in life
it's     like     it  

02:45:16.511   02:45:16.521  
it's like   it
  

02:45:16.521   02:45:18.671  
it's like   it
took     out     people  

02:45:18.671   02:45:18.681  
took you out   and so the fact that people
  

02:45:18.681   02:45:21.970  
took you out   and so the fact that people 
   but  

02:45:21.970   02:45:21.980  
   but
  

02:45:21.980   02:45:24.250  
   but
it     just  

02:45:24.250   02:45:24.260  
it doesn't help that's the thing it   just
  

02:45:24.260   02:45:26.680  
it doesn't help that's the thing it   just
stores     catastrophe     and  

02:45:26.680   02:45:26.690  
stores up the catastrophe   for later and
  

02:45:26.690   02:45:30.131  
stores up the catastrophe   for later and
so     eat  

02:45:30.131   02:45:30.141  
so the better the better   idea is to eat
  

02:45:30.141   02:45:31.690  
so the better the better   idea is to eat
a     little     you  

02:45:31.690   02:45:31.700  
a little   that you
  

02:45:31.700   02:45:33.511  
a little   that you 
   month  

02:45:33.511   02:45:33.521  
  don't have to overdose in a month
  

02:45:33.521   02:45:36.390  
  don't have to overdose in a month
it's     that     the  

02:45:36.390   02:45:36.400  
it's something   and it is the
  

02:45:36.400   02:45:40.381  
it's something   and it is the
case     think     you  

02:45:40.381   02:45:40.391  
case   because you don't you
  

02:45:40.391   02:45:42.270  
case   because you don't you
aren't     don't  

02:45:42.270   02:45:42.280  
aren't forced first of all you don't
 

02:45:42.280   02:45:43.921  
aren't forced first of all you don't
   I  

02:45:43.921   02:45:43.931  
  learn unless you're forced to learn I
  

02:45:43.931   02:45:45.660  
  learn unless you're forced to learn I
know     that  

02:45:45.660   02:45:45.670  
know there's alternatives to that
 

02:45:45.670   02:45:47.131  
know there's alternatives to that
   for  

02:45:47.131   02:45:47.141  
  there's the voluntary search for
  

02:45:47.141   02:45:48.930  
  there's the voluntary search for
knowledge     fine     and  

02:45:48.930   02:45:48.940  
knowledge   thing and
  

02:45:48.940   02:45:52.200  
knowledge   thing and
that     antidote     apart  

02:45:52.200   02:45:52.210  
that is an antidote   to this but apart
  

02:45:52.210   02:45:56.131  
that is an antidote   to this but apart
from     you  

02:45:56.131   02:45:56.141  
from that   speaking more practically you
  

02:45:56.141   02:45:58.020  
from that   speaking more practically you
tend     learn     forced  

02:45:58.020   02:45:58.030  
tend not to   unless you're forced
  

02:45:58.030   02:46:00.450  
tend not to   unless you're forced 
   to  

02:46:00.450   02:46:00.460  
  to learn and it's and what you tend to
  

02:46:00.460   02:46:02.461  
  to learn and it's and what you tend to 
   and  

02:46:02.461   02:46:02.471  
  learn by force are difficult lessons and
  

02:46:02.471   02:46:07.560  
  learn by force are difficult lessons and
so     are     not  

02:46:07.560   02:46:07.570  
so people   to not
  

02:46:07.570   02:46:11.250  
so people   to not 
   but  

02:46:11.250   02:46:11.260  
   out it's not surprising but
  

02:46:11.260   02:46:12.660  
   out it's not surprising but
it's     they     the  

02:46:12.660   02:46:12.670  
it's because they   don't understand the
  

02:46:12.670   02:46:16.970  
it's because they   don't understand the
consequences    you  

02:46:16.970   02:46:16.980  
consequences   know you you
  

02:46:16.980   02:46:19.680  
consequences   know you you
it's     they're  

02:46:19.680   02:46:19.690  
it's   because maybe it's because they're
  

02:46:19.690   02:46:21.330  
it's   because maybe it's because they're
convinced    for  

02:46:21.330   02:46:21.340  
convinced   that there's some way of for
  

02:46:21.340   02:46:23.430  
convinced   that there's some way of for
stalling    and  

02:46:23.430   02:46:23.440  
stalling   the necessary learning and
  

02:46:23.440   02:46:26.820  
stalling   the necessary learning and
there     it  

02:46:26.820   02:46:26.830  
there isn't any way of for stalling   it
  

02:46:26.830   02:46:28.290  
there isn't any way of for stalling   it 
   the  

02:46:28.290   02:46:28.300  
   make it worse in the
  

02:46:28.300   02:46:30.421  
   make it worse in the 
   you  

02:46:30.421   02:46:30.431  
   and you
  

02:46:30.431   02:46:33.570  
   and you
make     harder     why  

02:46:33.570   02:46:33.580  
make the lesson harder   and so that's why
  

02:46:33.580   02:46:35.940  
make the lesson harder   and so that's why
in     there's  

02:46:35.940   02:46:35.950  
in so many religious doctrines there's
 

02:46:35.950   02:46:38.820  
in so many religious doctrines there's
emphasis     humility    and  

02:46:38.820   02:46:38.830  
emphasis on humility   you know and
  

02:46:38.830   02:46:42.180  
emphasis on humility   you know and
humility    it's  

02:46:42.180   02:46:42.190  
humility   it's
  

02:46:42.190   02:46:44.940  
humility   it's
to     enough  

02:46:44.940   02:46:44.950  
to understand that you don't   know enough
  

02:46:44.950   02:46:46.440  
to understand that you don't   know enough
so     going     be  

02:46:46.440   02:46:46.450  
so that your life isn't going   to be
  

02:46:46.450   02:46:49.261  
so that your life isn't going   to be
miserable     chance     to  

02:46:49.261   02:46:49.271  
miserable   you get to
  

02:46:49.271   02:46:51.750  
miserable   you get to
grab    you  

02:46:51.750   02:46:51.760  
grab   something new that will help you
  

02:46:51.760   02:46:54.000  
grab   something new that will help you
along    as  

02:46:54.000   02:46:54.010  
along   you should take it as
  

02:46:54.010   02:46:56.520  
along   you should take it as
fast     you     a  

02:46:56.520   02:46:56.530  
fast as   to have a
  

02:46:56.530   02:47:02.490  
fast as   to have a
very     reality  

02:47:02.490   02:47:02.500  
very tragic   I would say view of reality
  

02:47:02.500   02:47:04.860  
very tragic   I would say view of reality 
   not  

02:47:04.860   02:47:04.870  
   not
  

02:47:04.870   02:47:06.750  
   not
just     you  

02:47:06.750   02:47:06.760  
just   tragedy it's also malevolence you
  

02:47:06.760   02:47:08.070  
just   tragedy it's also malevolence you
have     those     are

have to understand   are
waiting     for     you

waiting for   you and that makes you
  

02:47:10.931   02:47:13.320  
waiting for   you and that makes you
desperate     to     might  

02:47:13.320   02:47:13.330  
desperate enough   that might
  

02:47:13.330   02:47:15.600  
desperate enough   that might
be    out  

02:47:15.600   02:47:15.610  
be   to fall out
