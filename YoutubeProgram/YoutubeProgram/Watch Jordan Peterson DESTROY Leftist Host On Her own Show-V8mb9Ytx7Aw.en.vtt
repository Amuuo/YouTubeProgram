don't   doing that at all 
   top  

00:03:52.800   00:03:52.810  
   pretty much from top

you expect   up and running
that's     question  

00:05:30.990   00:05:31.000  
  that's a very good question

00:10:55.930   00:10:55.940  
  control it seems like that narrative
  

00:10:55.940   00:10:57.670  
  control it seems like that narrative
certainly     it  

00:10:57.670   00:10:57.680  
certainly out there   yeah true it is it
  

00:10:57.680   00:10:59.079  
certainly out there   yeah true it is it
