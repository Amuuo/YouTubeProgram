contributing   I think
  

00:09:50.880   00:09:52.610  
contributing   I think
that     parents  

00:09:52.610   00:09:52.620  
that can't be laid directly   at parents
  

00:09:52.620   00:09:55.280  
that can't be laid directly   at parents
feet     so  

00:09:55.280   00:09:55.290  
feet   I mean we have fewer children so
  

00:09:55.290   00:09:57.560  
feet   I mean we have fewer children so
they're     raised  

00:09:57.560   00:09:57.570  
they're more special   they're not raised
  

00:09:57.570   00:10:00.260  
they're more special   they're not raised
so     and  

00:10:00.260   00:10:00.270  
so much by their siblings right   so and
  

00:10:00.270   00:10:02.300  
so much by their siblings right   so and
people     older     and  

00:10:02.300   00:10:02.310  
people   and
  

00:10:02.310   00:10:05.090  
people   and
so     more  

00:10:05.090   00:10:05.100  
so they're more   there they're much more
  

00:10:05.100   00:10:06.800  
so they're more   there they're much more
careful     their     sense  

00:10:06.800   00:10:06.810  
careful with their   kids in some sense
  

00:10:06.810   00:10:09.020  
careful with their   kids in some sense
and    ways  

00:10:09.020   00:10:09.030
