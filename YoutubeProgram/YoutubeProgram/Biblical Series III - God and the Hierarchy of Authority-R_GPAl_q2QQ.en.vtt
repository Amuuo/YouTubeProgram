and that's   actually something that we
could     know

that     idea     is

literally     you  

00:04:14.360   00:04:14.370  
literally   because I don't know what you
  

00:04:14.370   00:04:16.009  
literally   because I don't know what you
know     and  

00:04:16.009   00:04:16.019  
know there's an emphasis on day and
 

00:04:16.019   00:04:18.890

nighttime interchanges   that are based on
the     claw

the claw
 

00:04:27.389   00:04:29.179  
the claw
on     clock    bit  

00:04:29.179   00:04:29.189  
on the earthly clock   seems to be a bit
  

00:04:29.189   00:04:31.159  
on the earthly clock   seems to be a bit
absurd     think  

00:04:31.159   00:04:31.169  
absurd when   you first start to think
  

00:04:31.169   00:04:32.839  
absurd when   you first start to think 
   so  

00:04:32.839   00:04:32.849  
   the cosmos so
  

00:04:32.849   00:04:34.850  
   the cosmos so
just     literal  

00:04:34.850   00:04:34.860  
just doesn't seem   to me that a literal
  

00:04:34.860   00:04:37.100  
just doesn't seem   to me that a literal
interpretation     mean  

00:04:37.100   00:04:37.110  
interpretation is appropriate   and I mean
  

00:04:37.110   00:04:38.540  
interpretation is appropriate   and I mean
it's     not  

00:04:38.540   00:04:38.550  
it's another thing that you might not
 

00:04:38.550   00:04:39.980  
it's another thing that you might not
know     but    early  

00:04:39.980   00:04:39.990  
know but   you know many of the early

something that Immanuel Kant   as I said

  last time put forward as an argument
  

00:05:46.259   00:05:48.230  
  last time put forward as an argument
against     the

against   the idea that all of the

  sense data and the reason that Kant
  

00:05:53.849   00:05:55.909  
  sense data and the reason that Kant
objected     to     absolutely  

00:05:55.909   00:05:55.919  
objected to   that and he was absolutely
  

00:05:55.919   00:05:58.100  
objected to   that and he was absolutely
right     about     make  

00:05:58.100   00:05:58.110  
   this is that you can't make
  

00:05:58.110   00:05:59.749  
   this is that you can't make

  possible and that's really being 
   the

   I would say beyond the

   I would say beyond the
shadow     doubt     and

shadow of a doubt   the 1960s and
  

00:06:12.960   00:06:14.839  
shadow of a doubt   the 1960s and 
   was  

00:06:14.839   00:06:14.849  
   best demonstration of that was
  

00:06:14.849   00:06:16.070  
   best demonstration of that was 
   of  

00:06:16.070   00:06:16.080  
  actually the initial failure of
  

00:06:16.080   00:06:18.140  
  actually the initial failure of
artificial     intelligence     the

artificial   because when the

autonomous robots and artificial
 

00:06:23.610   00:06:27.079  
autonomous robots and artificial
intelligence     they 

00:06:27.079   00:06:27.089  
intelligence back in the 1960s what they
 

00:06:27.089   00:06:28.760  
intelligence back in the 1960s what they
didn't     and    them  

00:06:28.760   00:06:28.770  
didn't understand and   what stole them
  

00:06:28.770   00:06:30.980  
didn't understand and   what stole them
terribly     the     was  

00:06:30.980   00:06:30.990  
terribly until about the   early 1990s was
  

00:06:30.990   00:06:33.409  
terribly until about the   early 1990s was
that     problem     of  

00:06:33.409   00:06:33.419  
that it was almost that the problem   of
  

00:06:33.419   00:06:34.670  
that it was almost that the problem   of
perception     much     problem  

00:06:34.670   00:06:34.680  
perception with a much   deeper problem
  

00:06:34.680   00:06:36.469  
perception with a much   deeper problem 
   because  

00:06:36.469   00:06:36.479  
   because
  

00:06:36.479   00:06:37.820  
   because
like     when     just  

00:06:37.820   00:06:37.830  
   at the world you just
  

00:06:37.830   00:06:39.499  
   at the world you just 
   there  

00:06:39.499   00:06:39.509  
   there
  

00:06:39.509   00:06:41.170  
   there 
   don't  

00:06:41.170   00:06:41.180  
  and by the way you don't
  

00:06:41.180   00:06:43.600  
  and by the way you don't
objects    know  

00:06:43.600   00:06:43.610  
objects   you see tools just so you know
  

00:06:43.610   00:06:45.340  
objects   you see tools just so you know 
   clear  

00:06:45.340   00:06:45.350  
   quite clear
  

00:06:45.350   00:06:47.770  
   quite clear 
   utility  

00:06:47.770   00:06:47.780  
  you don't see objects and infer utility
  

00:06:47.780   00:06:50.800  
  you don't see objects and infer utility
you     object  

00:06:50.800   00:06:50.810  
you see useful things and infer object
 

00:06:50.810   00:06:52.270  
you see useful things and infer object
   what  

00:06:52.270   00:06:52.280  
  so it's actually the reverse of what
  

00:06:52.280   00:06:54.310  
  so it's actually the reverse of what
people     generally     is  

00:06:54.310   00:06:54.320  
   think but the point is
  

00:06:54.320   00:06:56.020  
   think but the point is
is     regardless     see  

00:06:56.020   00:06:56.030  
is that   of whether you see
  

00:06:56.030   00:06:57.969  
is that   of whether you see
objects     things     look  

00:06:57.969   00:06:57.979  
objects or useful things   when you look
  

00:06:57.979   00:06:59.710  
objects or useful things   when you look 
   you  

00:06:59.710   00:06:59.720  
  at the world you just see it and you
  

00:06:59.720   00:07:01.060  
  at the world you just see it and you 
   because  

00:07:01.060   00:07:01.070  
  think well seeing is easy because
  

00:07:01.070   00:07:02.260  
  think well seeing is easy because
they're     have  

00:07:02.260   00:07:02.270  
they're the   things are and all you have
  

00:07:02.270   00:07:03.879  
they're the   things are and all you have 
   head  

00:07:03.879   00:07:03.889  
   know turn your head
  

00:07:03.889   00:07:06.189  
   know turn your head
and     wrong  

00:07:06.189   00:07:06.199  
and they appear and that's just so wrong
 

00:07:06.199   00:07:08.320  
and they appear and that's just so wrong
that   to  

00:07:08.320   00:07:08.330  
that   it's it's almost impossible to
  

00:07:08.330   00:07:10.960  
that   it's it's almost impossible to
overstate     perception  

00:07:10.960   00:07:10.970  
overstate   like the problem of perception
  

00:07:10.970   00:07:13.360  
overstate   like the problem of perception
is     the  

00:07:13.360   00:07:13.370  
is staggeringly difficult and one of the
 

00:07:13.370   00:07:14.920  
is staggeringly difficult and one of the
primary   don't  

00:07:14.920   00:07:14.930  
primary   that we still don't
  

00:07:14.930   00:07:16.779  
primary   that we still don't 
   there  

00:07:16.779   00:07:16.789  
  really have autonomous robots so there
  

00:07:16.789   00:07:18.070  
  really have autonomous robots so there
were     lot     in  

00:07:18.070   00:07:18.080  
were a lot   we were in
  

00:07:18.080   00:07:20.560  
were a lot   we were in 
   you  

00:07:20.560   00:07:20.570  
  the 1960s because it turned out that you
  

00:07:20.570   00:07:21.939

have a body before   you can see because
  

00:07:28.550   00:07:30.850  
have a body before   you can see because 
   of  

00:07:30.850   00:07:30.860  
   the act of
  

00:07:30.860   00:07:32.890

the patterns   of the body it's not things
  

00:07:35.810   00:07:37.450  
the patterns   of the body it's not things
are     you  

00:07:37.450   00:07:37.460  
are   out there you see them then you
  

00:07:37.460   00:07:39.400  
are   out there you see them then you
think     them  

00:07:39.400   00:07:39.410  
think   about them then you evaluate them
  

00:07:39.410   00:07:40.900  
think   about them then you evaluate them
then     decide     then  

00:07:40.900   00:07:40.910  
then you decide   then
  

00:07:40.910   00:07:43.150  
then you decide   then 
   that  

00:07:43.150   00:07:43.160  
  you act I mean that you could call that
  

00:07:43.160   00:07:46.210  
  you act I mean that you could call that
a     processing  

00:07:46.210   00:07:46.220  
a folk idea of psychological processing
 

00:07:46.220   00:07:48.550  
a folk idea of psychological processing
or   how  

00:07:48.550   00:07:48.560  
or   not how
  

00:07:48.560   00:07:50.879  
or   not how
it    map  

00:07:50.879   00:07:50.889  
it   example map
  

00:07:50.889   00:07:52.990  
it   example map
one    right  

00:07:52.990   00:07:53.000  
one   of the things they do is map right
  

00:07:53.000   00:07:55.089  
one   of the things they do is map right 
   they  

00:07:55.089   00:07:55.099  
   for example they
  

00:07:55.099   00:07:56.950  
   for example they
might    system  

00:07:56.950   00:07:56.960  
might   right onto your emotional system
  

00:07:56.960   00:07:58.750  
might   right onto your emotional system
so     it's     example  

00:07:58.750   00:07:58.760  
so it's   actually possible for example
  

00:07:58.760   00:08:01.839  
so it's   actually possible for example 
   able  

00:08:01.839   00:08:01.849  
  for people to be blind and still be able
  

00:08:01.849   00:08:04.839  
  for people to be blind and still be able 
   to  

00:08:04.839   00:08:04.849  
  to detect facial expressions which is to
  

00:08:04.849   00:08:06.430  
  to detect facial expressions which is to
say     who's  

00:08:06.430   00:08:06.440  
say   you can with someone who's
  

00:08:06.440   00:08:08.080  
say   you can with someone who's
cortically     so     their  

00:08:08.080   00:08:08.090  
cortically blind   they've had their
  

00:08:08.090   00:08:09.730  
cortically blind   they've had their

00:08:27.590   00:08:29.529  
is then imagine   that those patterns are
transmitted    electromagnetically  

00:08:29.529   00:08:29.539  
transmitted   to you electromagnetically
  

00:08:29.539   00:08:31.210  
transmitted   to you electromagnetically
you    that  

00:08:31.210   00:08:31.220  
you   that
  

00:08:31.220   00:08:33.100  
you   that 
   retina  

00:08:33.100   00:08:33.110  
  the pattern is duplicated on the retina
  

00:08:33.110   00:08:35.050  
  the pattern is duplicated on the retina
and     propagated  

00:08:35.050   00:08:35.060  
and then that pattern is propagated
 

00:08:35.060   00:08:36.670  
and then that pattern is propagated
along   the  

00:08:36.670   00:08:36.680  
along   the
  

00:08:36.680   00:08:38.380  
along   the
pattern    your  

00:08:38.380   00:08:38.390  
pattern   is distributed throughout your
  

00:08:38.390   00:08:40.540  
pattern   is distributed throughout your 
   up  

00:08:40.540   00:08:40.550  
  brain and some of that pattern makes up
  

00:08:40.550   00:08:43.149  
  brain and some of that pattern makes up
what     other  

00:08:43.149   00:08:43.159  
what you call conscious vision   but other
  

00:08:43.159   00:08:45.430  
what you call conscious vision   but other
parts    so  

00:08:45.430   00:08:45.440  
parts   it just activate your body so
  

00:08:45.440   00:08:47.860  
parts   it just activate your body so
for     I  

00:08:47.860   00:08:47.870  
  for example when I look at this when I

huh you know   when I look at it
  

00:08:56.330   00:08:58.840  
huh you know   when I look at it 
   soon

the optimal size to pick that up and
   then  

00:09:16.930   00:09:16.940  
  it's not that I see the bottle and then
  

00:09:16.940   00:09:19.330  
  it's not that I see the bottle and then
think    that's  

00:09:19.330   00:09:19.340  
   my hand that's
  

00:09:19.340   00:09:22.210  
   my hand that's
too     slow     motor  

00:09:22.210   00:09:22.220  
too slow   it's that I use my motor motor
  

00:09:22.220   00:09:23.950  
too slow   it's that I use my motor motor
cortex     that's  

00:09:23.950   00:09:23.960  
cortex to perceive the bottle   and that's
  

00:09:23.960   00:09:25.450

   of  

00:09:25.450   00:09:25.460

central brain   but they could do things
  

00:10:15.770   00:10:18.130  
central brain   but they could do things
like    they  

00:10:18.130   00:10:18.140  
like   and so they
  

00:10:18.140   00:10:19.840  
like   and so they
could     their  

00:10:19.840   00:10:19.850  
could perceive   light that their
  

00:10:19.850   00:10:22.360  
could perceive   light that their
perception     was     away  

00:10:22.360   00:10:22.370  
perception was   running away
  

00:10:22.370   00:10:25.150  
perception was   running away
from     right     perception  

00:10:25.150   00:10:25.160  
   and so perception perception
  

00:10:25.160   00:10:27.760  
   and so perception perception
is     action  

00:10:27.760   00:10:27.770  
is very very very tightly tied to action
 

00:10:27.770   00:10:29.290  
is very very very tightly tied to action

00:10:29.300   00:10:32.590  
in ways that people don't normally
   that

   pull

  three and a half billion years to pull
  

00:10:41.450   00:10:43.180  
  three and a half billion years to pull
off     death

off   right there's being a lot of death
  

00:10:43.190   00:10:45.820  
off   right there's being a lot of death
as     to     form  

00:10:45.820   00:10:45.830  
as a prerequisite to   the embodied form
  

00:10:45.830   00:10:48.010  
as a prerequisite to   the embodied form 
   that  

00:10:48.010   00:10:48.020  
  that you take and so it's taken all that
  

00:10:48.020   00:10:49.840  
  that you take and so it's taken all that 
   something  

00:10:49.840   00:10:49.850  
  trial and error to produce something
  

00:10:49.850   00:10:51.790  
  trial and error to produce something 
   the  

00:10:51.790   00:10:51.800  
  like you that can interact with the
  

00:10:51.800   00:10:53.470  
  like you that can interact with the
complexity     to  

00:10:53.470   00:10:53.480  
complexity of the world well enough to
 

00:10:53.480   00:10:55.660  
complexity of the world well enough to
   so  

00:10:55.660   00:10:55.670  
  last the relatively paltry 80 or so
  

00:10:55.670   00:10:58.390  
  last the relatively paltry 80 or so
years     that     think  

00:10:58.390   00:10:58.400  
years that   and so I think
  

00:10:58.400   00:11:00.970  
years that   and so I think 
   I  

00:11:00.970   00:11:00.980

   a

   least it's a
useful     idea  

00:11:06.460   00:11:06.470  
useful   hypothesis I think the idea
  

00:11:06.470   00:11:08.440  
useful   hypothesis I think the idea
God     something     the

the term dominance hierarchy   which might
be     for     for

be fine for   chimpanzees and for
  

00:16:31.140   00:16:33.620  
be fine for   chimpanzees and for
lobsters     creatures     but  

00:16:33.620   00:16:33.630  
lobsters   like that but

lobsters   like that but
not     for     chimpanzees  

00:16:35.870   00:16:35.880  
not not first not not for   chimpanzees

not not first not not for   chimpanzees
even     something

even so much and and he said something

even so much and and he said something
   the  

00:16:40.070   00:16:40.080  
   interesting he thought that the

   was actually
a    century

a   projection of a early 20th century
  

00:16:45.240   00:16:48.590

   observed and the
  

00:16:50.610   00:16:52.370  
   observed and the 
   structure  

00:16:52.370   00:16:52.380  
  notion that the hierarchical structure
  

00:16:52.380   00:16:54.020  
  notion that the hierarchical structure
that     characterizes     say  

00:16:54.020   00:16:54.030  
that you see   say
  

00:16:54.030   00:16:56.810  
that you see   say
mating     for     example  

00:16:56.810   00:16:56.820  
mating hierarchies in chimps for   example
  

00:16:56.820   00:16:58.760  
mating hierarchies in chimps for   example
the     on  

00:16:58.760   00:16:58.770  
the idea   that that was predicated on
  

00:16:58.770   00:17:00.829  
the idea   that that was predicated on
power     projection     a

power   a
  

00:17:00.839   00:17:02.660  
power   a
kind     of     thought  

00:17:02.660   00:17:02.670  
kind of   and I thought
  

00:17:02.670   00:17:04.460  
kind of   and I thought
that     for     time  

00:17:04.460   00:17:04.470  
that   long time
  

00:17:04.470   00:17:06.500  
that   long time
when     because  

00:17:06.500   00:17:06.510  
when he said   that because like because
  

00:17:06.510   00:17:08.030  
when he said   that because like because
I'd     term  

00:17:08.030   00:17:08.040  
I'd really   been used to using the term
  

00:17:08.040   00:17:10.189  
I'd really   been used to using the term
dominant     me  

00:17:10.189   00:17:10.199  
dominant IURC and I thought he told me
 

00:17:10.199   00:17:11.990  
dominant IURC and I thought he told me
all   annoying  

00:17:11.990   00:17:12.000  
all   that I thought that's so annoying
  

00:17:12.000   00:17:14.419  
all   that I thought that's so annoying 
   be  

00:17:14.419   00:17:14.429  
  it's so annoying because it might be
  

00:17:14.429   00:17:16.100  
  it's so annoying because it might be 
   to  

00:17:16.100   00:17:16.110  
  right and then it took me months to
  

00:17:16.110   00:17:18.140  
  right and then it took me months to 
   was  

00:17:18.140   00:17:18.150  
   about it and then I and then I was
  

00:17:18.150   00:17:19.819  
   about it and then I and then I was
also     to     same

   all at the same
  

00:17:19.829   00:17:22.100  
   all at the same
time     also  

00:17:22.100   00:17:22.110

00:20:33.720   00:20:33.730  
because they   get found out quite quickly
  

00:20:33.730   00:20:35.700  
because they   get found out quite quickly
and     is  

00:20:35.700   00:20:35.710  
and as soon   as their reputation is

and as soon   as their reputation is
shattered     with  

00:20:37.500   00:20:37.510  
shattered then   they can't get away with

shattered then   they can't get away with 
   all  

00:20:40.290   00:20:40.300  
   okay so all
  

00:20:40.300   00:20:42.810  
   okay so all
of     is  

00:20:42.810   00:20:42.820  
of this is to say   that there is

of this is to say   that there is
something     the

something   very interesting about the

something   very interesting about the
pattern     that  

00:20:47.690   00:20:47.700  
pattern of behavior   so imagine that

pattern of behavior   so imagine that
imagine    working  

00:20:50.610   00:20:50.620  
imagine   that sexual selection is working
  

00:20:50.620   00:20:52.830  
imagine   that sexual selection is working 
   that  

00:20:52.830   00:20:52.840  
  something like this and we know that
  

00:20:52.840   00:20:54.810  
  something like this and we know that
sexual     very  

00:20:54.810   00:20:54.820  
sexual   selection is a very very very
  

00:20:54.820   00:20:57.330  
sexual   selection is a very very very 
   even  

00:20:57.330   00:20:57.340  
  very powerful biological force even
  

00:20:57.340   00:20:59.190  
  very powerful biological force even
though     almost

originally wrote   about it thinking
mostly    they  

00:21:04.320   00:21:04.330  
mostly   about natural selection they
  

00:21:04.330   00:21:05.760  
mostly   about natural selection they
didn't     sexual     selection

didn't like the idea   selection
  

00:21:05.770   00:21:07.170  
didn't like the idea   selection
because     the  

00:21:07.170   00:21:07.180  
because it tended to introduce the

  you know but so imagine on the one hand
  

00:21:13.960   00:21:16.380  
  you know but so imagine on the one hand 
   know  

00:21:16.380   00:21:16.390  
  that you have a male hierarchy we know
  

00:21:16.390   00:21:17.700  
  that you have a male hierarchy we know
that     hierarchy  

00:21:17.700   00:21:17.710  
that the men at   the top of the hierarchy
  

00:21:17.710   00:21:20.610  
that the men at   the top of the hierarchy
are     likely     reprimanded  

00:21:20.610   00:21:20.620  
are much more   reprimanded
  

00:21:20.620   00:21:22.800  
are much more   reprimanded
the    men  

00:21:22.800   00:21:22.810  
the   it's particularly true of men
  

00:21:22.810   00:21:24.480  
the   it's particularly true of men 
   female  

00:21:24.480   00:21:24.490  
  so you have twice as many female
  

00:21:24.490   00:21:26.700  
  so you have twice as many female
ancestors     ancestors     not  

00:21:26.700   00:21:26.710  
ancestors as you have male ancestors   not
  

00:21:26.710   00:21:28.440  
ancestors as you have male ancestors   not 
   it  

00:21:28.440   00:21:28.450  
  going to do the math but and I know it
  

00:21:28.450   00:21:30.090  
  going to do the math but and I know it
doesn't     sound     could  

00:21:30.090   00:21:30.100  
doesn't   plausible but you could
  

00:21:30.100   00:21:31.710  
doesn't   plausible but you could
look     and     it's  

00:21:31.710   00:21:31.720  
look it up and   out it's it's
  

00:21:31.720   00:21:33.360  
look it up and   out it's it's
perfectly     actually  

00:21:33.360   00:21:33.370  
perfectly reasonable fact that   actually
  

00:21:33.370   00:21:34.110  
perfectly reasonable fact that   actually
happens     true  

00:21:34.110   00:21:34.120  
happens to   be true
  

00:21:34.120   00:21:36.270  
happens to   be true
so     there's     many  

00:21:36.270   00:21:36.280  
so there's   as if twice as many
  

00:21:36.280   00:21:38.190  
so there's   as if twice as many
female     are  

00:21:38.190   00:21:38.200  
female ancestors because females are
 

00:21:38.200   00:21:40.800  
female ancestors because females are
twice     as    leave  

00:21:40.800   00:21:40.810  
twice as   on average to leave
  

00:21:40.810   00:21:43.860  
twice as   on average to leave 
   any  

00:21:43.860   00:21:43.870  
   now what happens is any
  

00:21:43.870   00:21:46.110  
   now what happens is any
man     to  

00:21:46.110   00:21:46.120  
man man who does reproduce   tends to
  

00:21:46.120   00:21:48.060  
man man who does reproduce   tends to
reproduce     but     of  

00:21:48.060   00:21:48.070  
reproduce   a bunch of
  

00:21:48.070   00:21:50.280  
reproduce   a bunch of
the    would  

00:21:50.280   00:21:50.290  
the   reproduce zero whereas so it would
  

00:21:50.290   00:21:52.140  
the   reproduce zero whereas so it would
be     the     has  

00:21:52.140   00:21:52.150  
be the   has
  

00:21:52.150   00:21:54.690  
be the   has
two     children     who  

00:21:54.690   00:21:54.700  
two children   and the average man who
  

00:21:54.700   00:21:56.700  
two children   and the average man who 
   obviously  

00:21:56.700   00:21:56.710  
   obviously
  

00:21:56.710   00:21:59.520  
   obviously
and     has  

00:21:59.520   00:21:59.530  
and the average   woman who reproduces has
  

00:21:59.530   00:22:03.030  
and the average   woman who reproduces has
one     child     there's  

00:22:03.030   00:22:03.040  
one child   so that means that there's
  

00:22:03.040   00:22:05.250  
one child   so that means that there's
twice     as     as  

00:22:05.250   00:22:05.260  
twice   line as
  

00:22:05.260   00:22:07.320  
twice   line as
there     deal  

00:22:07.320   00:22:07.330  
there is males   so that that's a big deal
  

00:22:07.330   00:22:09.390  
there is males   so that that's a big deal
and     imagine     works  

00:22:09.390   00:22:09.400  
and and so imagine   that it works
  

00:22:09.400   00:22:13.799  
and and so imagine   that it works
something     like     elect  

00:22:13.799   00:22:13.809  
something   this so the men elect
  

00:22:13.809   00:22:17.729  
something   this so the men elect
the     and  

00:22:17.729   00:22:17.739  
the   competent men who are admired and
  

00:22:17.739   00:22:21.959  
the   competent men who are admired and
who     are     dominant  

00:22:21.959   00:22:21.969  
who are   I can't say dominant
  

00:22:21.969   00:22:23.669  
who are   I can't say dominant 
   of  

00:22:23.669   00:22:23.679  
   are given positions of
  

00:22:23.679   00:22:25.409  
   are given positions of
authority    that  

00:22:25.409   00:22:25.419  
authority   let's put it that
  

00:22:25.419   00:22:28.080  
authority   let's put it that
way    it  

00:22:28.080   00:22:28.090  
way   and it's like an election now it
  

00:22:28.090   00:22:29.789  
way   and it's like an election now it
could     election  

00:22:29.789   00:22:29.799  
could   be an actual democratic election
  

00:22:29.799   00:22:31.499  
could   be an actual democratic election
but     of  

00:22:31.499   00:22:31.509  
but it's at   least an election of
  

00:22:31.509   00:22:34.019  
but it's at   least an election of
consensus     election  

00:22:34.019   00:22:34.029  
consensus   or it's at least an election
  

00:22:34.029   00:22:35.909  
consensus   or it's at least an election
of     him     for  

00:22:35.909   00:22:35.919  
of   for
  

00:22:35.919   00:22:38.009  
of   for
now     also     election  

00:22:38.009   00:22:38.019  
now which is also   a form of election
  

00:22:38.019   00:22:39.690  
now which is also   a form of election 
   know  

00:22:39.690   00:22:39.700  
   Tolerance you know
  

00:22:39.700   00:22:42.629  
   Tolerance you know
so     women  

00:22:42.629   00:22:42.639  
so so and then what happens is the women
 

00:22:42.639   00:22:44.369  
so so and then what happens is the women
for     part    the  

00:22:44.369   00:22:44.379  
for their part   peel from the top of the
  

00:22:44.379   00:22:46.579  
for their part   peel from the top of the 
   two  

00:22:46.579   00:22:46.589  
  mental hierarchy and so you've got two
  

00:22:46.589   00:22:49.739  
  mental hierarchy and so you've got two
factors     sexual  

00:22:49.739   00:22:49.749  
factors   that are driving human sexual
  

00:22:49.749   00:22:51.599  
factors   that are driving human sexual
selection     of  

00:22:51.599   00:22:51.609  
selection across vast stretches   of
  

00:22:51.609   00:22:53.759  
selection across vast stretches   of
evolutionary     election     of  

00:22:53.759   00:22:53.769

   to positions where they're
much     the  

00:22:57.779   00:22:57.789  
much more   likely to reproduce and the
  

00:22:57.789   00:22:59.999  
much more   likely to reproduce and the
second     of     peel

second is the tendency of   women to peel
  

00:23:00.009   00:23:01.859

00:23:35.459   00:23:35.469  
makes sense   if you want to figure
  

00:23:35.469   00:23:37.680  
makes sense   if you want to figure
out     the  

00:23:37.680   00:23:37.690  
  out who the best man is why not let the
  

00:23:37.690   00:23:40.589  
  out who the best man is why not let the
men     wins  

00:23:40.589   00:23:40.599  
men compete and the man who wins
 

00:23:40.599   00:23:42.599  
men compete and the man who wins
whatever     best 

00:23:42.599   00:23:42.609  
whatever the competition is is the best
 

00:23:42.609   00:23:44.669  
whatever the competition is is the best
man     definition    you  

00:23:44.669   00:23:44.679  
man by definition   how else would you
  

00:23:44.679   00:23:48.089  
man by definition   how else would you 
   telling  

00:23:48.089   00:23:48.099  
  define it so okay so why am I telling
  

00:23:48.099   00:23:50.279  
  define it so okay so why am I telling 
   is  

00:23:50.279   00:23:50.289  
  you all that well the reason is is
  

00:23:50.289   00:23:52.680  
  you all that well the reason is is
because     to     this  

00:23:52.680   00:23:52.690  
because it seems to   me that there's this
  

00:23:52.690   00:23:54.839  
because it seems to   me that there's this 
   interplay  

00:23:54.839   00:23:54.849  
  comp this being this complex interplay
  

00:23:54.849   00:23:57.959  
  comp this being this complex interplay
across     the  

00:23:57.959   00:23:57.969  
across   human evolution between the
  

00:23:57.969   00:24:00.209  
across   human evolution between the
election    hierarchy  

00:24:00.209   00:24:00.219  
election   the male dominance hierarchy
  

00:24:00.219   00:24:02.849  
election   the male dominance hierarchy 
   deal  

00:24:02.849   00:24:02.859  
  and sexual success and that's a big deal
  

00:24:02.859   00:24:05.339  
  and sexual success and that's a big deal
if     what  

00:24:05.339   00:24:05.349  
if it's true it could be   because what
  

00:24:05.349   00:24:07.320  
if it's true it could be   because what
would     happen     men  

00:24:07.320   00:24:07.330  
would happen   that as men
  

00:24:07.330   00:24:10.589  
would happen   that as men
evolved     better  

00:24:10.589   00:24:10.599  
evolved they would evolve   to be better
  

00:24:10.599   00:24:12.089  
evolved they would evolve   to be better
and     male  

00:24:12.089   00:24:12.099  
  and better at climbing up the male
  

00:24:12.099   00:24:13.919  
  and better at climbing up the male 
   weren't  

00:24:13.919   00:24:13.929  
   the ones who weren't
  

00:24:13.929   00:24:15.389  
   the ones who weren't
good     that     so  

00:24:15.389   00:24:15.399  
good at that   wouldn't reproduce so
  

00:24:15.399   00:24:17.609  
good at that   wouldn't reproduce so
obviously     to     but  

00:24:17.609   00:24:17.619  
obviously   but
  

00:24:17.619   00:24:19.769  
obviously   but
then     wouldn't     hierarchy  

00:24:19.769   00:24:19.779  
   be a hierarchy
  

00:24:19.779   00:24:20.999  
   be a hierarchy
because    of  

00:24:20.999   00:24:21.009  
   bunch of
  

00:24:21.009   00:24:22.499  
   bunch of
different     you  

00:24:22.499   00:24:22.509  
different   hierarchies and so then you
  

00:24:22.509   00:24:24.629  
different   hierarchies and so then you
might    commonalities  

00:24:24.629   00:24:24.639  
might   are there commonalities
  

00:24:24.639   00:24:26.549  
might   are there commonalities
across     hierarchies  

00:24:26.549   00:24:26.559  
across hierarchies
 

00:24:26.559   00:24:28.799  
across hierarchies
reasonable     to    mean  

00:24:28.799   00:24:28.809  
reasonable thing to   it mean
  

00:24:28.809   00:24:30.269  
reasonable thing to   it mean
they're    one  

00:24:30.269   00:24:30.279  
they're   not completely opposed to one
  

00:24:30.279   00:24:32.190  
they're   not completely opposed to one 
   success  

00:24:32.190   00:24:32.200  
   if you're more success
  

00:24:32.200   00:24:35.039  
   if you're more success
relatively     in     run  

00:24:35.039   00:24:35.049  
relatively more successful in   run
  

00:24:35.049   00:24:38.039  
relatively more successful in   run
hierarchy     it's  

00:24:38.039   00:24:38.049  
hierarchy then you're more probable it's
 

00:24:38.049   00:24:39.779  
hierarchy then you're more probable it's
more     probable    successful  

00:24:39.779   00:24:39.789  
more probable   successful
  

00:24:39.789   00:24:41.519  
more probable   successful
in     and     really  

00:24:41.519   00:24:41.529  
in another and   that's actually a really
  

00:24:41.529   00:24:43.710  
in another and   that's actually a really
good     intelligence  

00:24:43.710   00:24:43.720  
  good definition of general intelligence
  

00:24:43.720   00:24:46.019  
  good definition of general intelligence
or     the  

00:24:46.019   00:24:46.029  
or IQ   and that's actually one of the
  

00:24:46.029   00:24:47.850  
or IQ   and that's actually one of the 
   men  

00:24:47.850   00:24:47.860  
  things that women select men for now men
  

00:24:47.860   00:24:49.409  
  things that women select men for now men 
   the  

00:24:49.409   00:24:49.419  
  also select women for that but the
  

00:24:49.419   00:24:51.060  
  also select women for that but the
selection     from  

00:24:51.060   00:24:51.070  
selection   pressure is even higher from
  

00:24:51.070   00:24:53.460  
selection   pressure is even higher from
women     of  

00:24:53.460   00:24:53.470  
women to men and   general IQ is one of
  

00:24:53.470   00:24:55.289  
women to men and   general IQ is one of
the     across  

00:24:55.289   00:24:55.299  
the things that propels you up across
 

00:24:55.299   00:24:57.299  
the things that propels you up across
dominant   general  

00:24:57.299   00:24:57.309  
dominant   because it's a general
  

00:24:57.309   00:24:59.369  
dominant   because it's a general 
   other  

00:24:59.369   00:24:59.379  
  problem-solving mechanism and the other
  

00:24:59.379   00:25:00.720  
  problem-solving mechanism and the other
thing    some  

00:25:00.720   00:25:00.730  
thing   that seems to do that to some
  

00:25:00.730   00:25:02.460  
thing   that seems to do that to some 
   there's  

00:25:02.460   00:25:02.470  
   and there's
  

00:25:02.470   00:25:03.899  
   and there's
also     prefer  

00:25:03.899   00:25:03.909  
also some evidence   that women prefer
  

00:25:03.909   00:25:06.600  
also some evidence   that women prefer
conscientious     why  

00:25:06.600   00:25:06.610  
conscientious men so and of course why
 

00:25:06.610   00:25:08.279  
conscientious men so and of course why
wouldn't   them  

00:25:08.279   00:25:08.289  
wouldn't   trust them
  

00:25:08.289   00:25:10.919  
wouldn't   trust them 
   so  

00:25:10.919   00:25:10.929  
  and and and and and they work and so
  

00:25:10.929   00:25:12.690  
  and and and and and they work and so
those     things     you  

00:25:12.690   00:25:12.700  
those   so then you
  

00:25:12.700   00:25:15.210  
those   so then you 
   start  

00:25:15.210   00:25:15.220  
   start
  

00:25:15.220   00:25:17.070  
   start
to     hierarchy  

00:25:17.070   00:25:17.080  
to climb   the male dominance hierarchy
  

00:25:17.080   00:25:18.419  
to climb   the male dominance hierarchy
but     possible  

00:25:18.419   00:25:18.429  
but it's the set of   all possible
  

00:25:18.429   00:25:20.159  
but it's the set of   all possible
hierarchies     to  

00:25:20.159   00:25:20.169  
hierarchies that   they're adapted to
  

00:25:20.169   00:25:22.440  
hierarchies that   they're adapted to
climb     there's  

00:25:22.440   00:25:22.450  
climb and so then you think   there's
  

00:25:22.450   00:25:24.450  
climb and so then you think   there's
there's     attributes     be  

00:25:24.450   00:25:24.460  
there's a set   can be
  

00:25:24.460   00:25:27.539  
there's a set   can be
acted     embodied  

00:25:27.539   00:25:27.549  
acted out that and that can be embodied
 

00:25:27.549   00:25:29.220  
acted out that and that can be embodied
   that  

00:25:29.220   00:25:29.230  
   that
  

00:25:29.230   00:25:30.810  
   that
you're    any  

00:25:30.810   00:25:30.820  
   going to rise to the top of any
  

00:25:30.820   00:25:32.940  
   going to rise to the top of any
given     then     say  

00:25:32.940   00:25:32.950  
given hierarchy and then   you could say
  

00:25:32.950   00:25:36.210  
given hierarchy and then   you could say 
   then  

00:25:36.210   00:25:36.220  
   then
  

00:25:36.220   00:25:38.100  
   then
you     develop     of  

00:25:38.100   00:25:38.110  
you start to develop   an understanding of
  

00:25:38.110   00:25:40.379  
you start to develop   an understanding of
what     that     so  

00:25:40.379   00:25:40.389  
what that   pattern constitutes and so
  

00:25:40.389   00:25:42.440  
what that   pattern constitutes and so
that     abstract  

00:25:42.440   00:25:42.450  
that starts to   become the abstract
  

00:25:42.450   00:25:44.460  
that starts to   become the abstract
representation     of     like  

00:25:44.460   00:25:44.470  
representation of   something like
  

00:25:44.470   00:25:46.619  
representation of   something like
multi-dimensional     that's  

00:25:46.619   00:25:46.629  
multi-dimensional competence   and that's
  

00:25:46.629   00:25:48.509  
multi-dimensional competence   and that's
like     itself  

00:25:48.509   00:25:48.519  
like the abstraction of virtue itself
 

00:25:48.519   00:25:51.029  
like the abstraction of virtue itself
   of  

00:25:51.029   00:25:51.039  
   that has them none of
  

00:25:51.039   00:25:52.529  
   that has them none of 
   as  

00:25:52.529   00:25:52.539  
  that's arbitrary now and that's as
  

00:25:52.539   00:25:54.570  
  that's arbitrary now and that's as
bloody     biology     if  

00:25:54.570   00:25:54.580  
bloody well grounded in biology   if
  

00:25:54.580   00:25:56.399  
bloody well grounded in biology   if
anything     could     a  

00:25:56.399   00:25:56.409  
anything   be and I think that's a
  

00:25:56.409   00:25:58.680  
anything   be and I think that's a
really     like  

00:25:58.680   00:25:58.690  
really   hard argument to refute and like
  

00:25:58.690   00:25:59.999  
really   hard argument to refute and like
one     things     you  

00:25:59.999   00:26:00.009  
one of the things   I should tell you
  

00:26:00.009   00:26:02.519  
one of the things   I should tell you 
   think  

00:26:02.519   00:26:02.529  
   that when I think
  

00:26:02.529   00:26:04.259  
   that when I think
something     to  

00:26:04.259   00:26:04.269  
something I spend a long time trying to
 

00:26:04.269   00:26:05.580  
something I spend a long time trying to
figure   know  

00:26:05.580   00:26:05.590  
figure   out if it's wrong you know
  

00:26:05.590   00:26:07.320  
figure   out if it's wrong you know
because     like     every  

00:26:07.320   00:26:07.330  
because   from every
  

00:26:07.330   00:26:09.570  
because   from every
possible     weak  

00:26:09.570   00:26:09.580  
possible direction to see if it's a weak
 

00:26:09.580   00:26:11.519  
possible direction to see if it's a weak
idea     then 

00:26:11.519   00:26:11.529  
idea because if it's a weak idea then
 

00:26:11.529   00:26:13.049  
idea because if it's a weak idea then
I'd     with    and  

00:26:13.049   00:26:13.059  
I'd rather just dispense with   it and
  

00:26:13.059   00:26:14.730  
I'd rather just dispense with   it and
find     a  

00:26:14.730   00:26:14.740  
find something   better and I've had a
  

00:26:14.740   00:26:16.710  
find something   better and I've had a
real     trying     out  

00:26:16.710   00:26:16.720  
real hard   to figure out
  

00:26:16.720   00:26:19.919  
real hard   to figure out
what's     with     seems  

00:26:19.919   00:26:19.929  
   idea I it seems
  

00:26:19.929   00:26:22.379  
   idea I it seems
to     and  

00:26:22.379   00:26:22.389  
to me that it's pretty damn solid and
 

00:26:22.389   00:26:25.529  
to me that it's pretty damn solid and
then     watch 

00:26:25.529   00:26:25.539  
then the idea that you know if you watch
 

00:26:25.539   00:26:27.299  
then the idea that you know if you watch
what   and  

00:26:27.299   00:26:27.309  
what   on and
  

00:26:27.309   00:26:28.560

so     example     you  

00:26:45.080   00:26:45.090  
   a kid you

take a kid to   guy movie
  

00:26:47.700   00:26:49.490  
take a kid to   guy movie 
   he's

   and
figures     on  

00:26:54.080   00:26:54.090  
figures   out very quickly to zero in on
  

00:26:54.090   00:26:56.090  
figures   out very quickly to zero in on 
   there's  

00:26:56.090   00:26:56.100

   you know
one     out  

00:29:36.230   00:29:36.240  
one of   the things that we figured out
  

00:29:36.240   00:29:37.700  
one of   the things that we figured out
and     hard     out  

00:29:37.700   00:29:37.710  
and   figure out
  

00:29:37.710   00:29:41.690  
and   figure out 
   abstraction  

00:29:41.690   00:29:41.700  
   take the abstraction
  

00:29:41.700   00:29:44.000  
   take the abstraction
and     it     power  

00:29:44.000   00:29:44.010  
and divorce it   power
  

00:29:44.010   00:29:46.130  
and divorce it   power
structure     about     as  

00:29:46.130   00:29:46.140  
structure and then think about   as
  

00:29:46.140   00:29:48.140  
structure and then think about   as
something    abstraction

   as an abstraction

  but one of the things you see
  

00:30:06.630   00:30:07.940  
  but one of the things you see 
   Old  

00:30:07.940   00:30:07.950  
  continually happening in the Old
  

00:30:07.950   00:30:09.410  
  continually happening in the Old
Testament    the  

00:30:09.410   00:30:09.420  
   as the
  

00:30:09.420   00:30:11.630  
   as the 
   Israelite  

00:30:11.630   00:30:11.640  
  Israelite for example the Israelite
  

00:30:11.640   00:30:16.820  
  Israelite for example the Israelite

  Kings become almighty the real God comes
  

00:30:16.830   00:30:19.280  
  Kings become almighty the real God comes
along     into     and  

00:30:19.280   00:30:19.290  
along   pieces and
  

00:30:19.290   00:30:20.780  
along   pieces and
then     apart  

00:30:20.780   00:30:20.790  
  then the whole bloody state falls apart
  

00:30:20.790   00:30:22.640  
  then the whole bloody state falls apart
for     of     I  

00:30:22.640   00:30:22.650  
for like hundreds of   years it's like I
  

00:30:22.650   00:30:25.220  
for like hundreds of   years it's like I
think    have  

00:30:25.220   00:30:25.230  
think   that's a lesson that that we have
  

00:30:25.230   00:30:28.550  
think   that's a lesson that that we have
not     learned  

00:30:28.550   00:30:28.560  
not thoroughly   consciously yet learned
  

00:30:28.560   00:30:30.650  
not thoroughly   consciously yet learned
it's     we  

00:30:30.650   00:30:30.660  
it's still implicit in the narratives we
 

00:30:30.660   00:30:32.240  
it's still implicit in the narratives we
still     haven't    the  

00:30:32.240   00:30:32.250  
still haven't   figured out why that's the
  

00:30:32.250   00:30:32.480  
still haven't   figured out why that's the
case 

00:30:32.480   00:30:32.490  
case
 

00:30:32.490   00:30:34.400  
case
   hard  

00:30:34.400   00:30:34.410  
   that's a real hard
  

00:30:34.410   00:30:40.130  
   that's a real hard
argument     to     all  

00:30:40.130   00:30:40.140  
argument to   to to dispense with so all
  

00:30:40.140   00:30:42.820  
argument to   to to dispense with so all
right     this     bit  

00:30:42.820   00:30:42.830  
right so we looked at this   a little bit
  

00:30:42.830   00:30:45.620  
right so we looked at this   a little bit
the     a  

00:30:45.620   00:30:45.630  
  the Trinitarian idea is that there's a
  

00:30:45.630   00:30:50.320  
  the Trinitarian idea is that there's a 
   the  

00:30:50.320   00:30:50.330  
  there's a father that's maybe the
  

00:30:50.330   00:30:52.310  
  there's a father that's maybe the
dramatic    the  

00:30:52.310   00:30:52.320  
dramatic   representation of the
  

00:30:52.320   00:30:53.870  
dramatic   representation of the
structures     consciousness  

00:30:53.870   00:30:53.880  
structures   that underlie consciousness
  

00:30:53.880   00:30:55.070  
structures   that underlie consciousness
the     underlie  

00:30:55.070   00:30:55.080  
the embody structures that underlie
 

00:30:55.080   00:30:57.590  
the embody structures that underlie
consciousness     the    son  

00:30:57.590   00:30:57.600  
consciousness and then there's the   son
  

00:30:57.600   00:30:59.540  
consciousness and then there's the   son
and    but  

00:30:59.540   00:30:59.550  
and   that's that that's consciousness but
  

00:30:59.550   00:31:02.090  
and   that's that that's consciousness but
in     its     that's  

00:31:02.090   00:31:02.100  
in its   particular historical form that's
  

00:31:02.100   00:31:03.290  
in its   particular historical form that's
the     thing     about  

00:31:03.290   00:31:03.300  
the thing   about
  

00:31:03.300   00:31:05.000  
the thing   about
the     the     there's  

00:31:05.000   00:31:05.010  
the figure of the   son and then there's
  

00:31:05.010   00:31:06.680  
the figure of the   son and then there's
consciousness     to  

00:31:06.680   00:31:06.690  
consciousness as such and   that seems to
  

00:31:06.690   00:31:07.910  
consciousness as such and   that seems to 
   the  

00:31:07.910   00:31:07.920  
   like the
  

00:31:07.920   00:31:10.730  
   like the 
   mean  

00:31:10.730   00:31:10.740  
   spirit and so I mean
  

00:31:10.740   00:31:12.260  
   spirit and so I mean
these    from  

00:31:12.260   00:31:12.270  
these   from
  

00:31:12.270   00:31:14.000  
these   from
somewhere     right     history

they didn't just   nowhere 
   and  

00:31:17.960   00:31:17.970  
  and they emerge from from dreams and
  

00:31:17.970   00:31:19.970  
  and they emerge from from dreams and
hypothesis     all  

00:31:19.970   00:31:19.980  
hypothesis and artistic visions and all

of that   they
  

00:31:21.960   00:31:23.390  
of that   they
get     like  

00:31:23.390   00:31:23.400  
get clarified into something like
 

00:31:23.400   00:31:26.150  
get clarified into something like
   time  

00:31:26.150   00:31:26.160  
  consciousness but it takes a long time
  

00:31:26.160   00:31:31.130  
  consciousness but it takes a long time 
   you

we all we all exhibit this   faculty
called     a  

00:31:40.640   00:31:40.650  
called   consciousness I mean that's a
  

00:31:40.650   00:31:42.260  
called   consciousness I mean that's a
long     really  

00:31:42.260   00:31:42.270  
long   journey you know that's a really
  

00:31:42.270   00:31:43.340  
long   journey you know that's a really
long    be  

00:31:43.340   00:31:43.350  
long   journey and there's going to be

things I really   like about Jean Piaget 
   that  

00:31:49.610   00:31:49.620  
  the developmental psychologist was that
  

00:31:49.620   00:31:53.240  
  the developmental psychologist was that
he     act  

00:31:53.240   00:31:53.250  
he was so insistent   that children act
  

00:31:53.250   00:31:55.550  
he was so insistent   that children act
out     they  

00:31:55.550   00:31:55.560  
out and dramatized   ideas before they
  

00:31:55.560   00:31:58.670  
out and dramatized   ideas before they

looking     imitation  

00:32:05.390   00:32:05.400  
looking   at the importance of imitation
  

00:32:05.400   00:32:06.830  
looking   at the importance of imitation
for     cognition  

00:32:06.830   00:32:06.840  
for the development   of higher cognition
  

00:32:06.840   00:32:08.840  
for the development   of higher cognition 
   that  

00:32:08.840   00:32:08.850  
  in human beings and so the notion that
  

00:32:08.850   00:32:12.050  
  in human beings and so the notion that 
   them  

00:32:12.050   00:32:12.060  
   before we abstract them
  

00:32:12.060   00:32:13.550  
   before we abstract them
out     an  

00:32:13.550   00:32:13.560  
out and then represent them   in an
  

00:32:13.560   00:32:14.840  
out and then represent them   in an
articulated     think     an  

00:32:14.840   00:32:14.850  
articulated way I think   an
  

00:32:14.850   00:32:16.760  
articulated way I think   an
extraordinarily     really  

00:32:16.760   00:32:16.770  
extraordinarily solid idea and I really
 

00:32:16.770   00:32:18.410  
extraordinarily solid idea and I really
   way  

00:32:18.410   00:32:18.420  
   any other way
  

00:32:18.420   00:32:20.900  
   any other way
and     that  

00:32:20.900   00:32:20.910  
  and if you watch children you see that
  

00:32:20.910   00:32:22.960  
  and if you watch children you see that
like     doing  

00:32:22.960   00:32:22.970  
like think   about what a child is doing
  

00:32:22.970   00:32:26.030  
like think   about what a child is doing
when     house  

00:32:26.030   00:32:26.040  
  when he plays house or she plays house

  when he plays house or she plays house 
   father  

00:32:29.150   00:32:29.160  
  you know the child acts out the father
  

00:32:29.160   00:32:31.340  
  you know the child acts out the father
or     interesting  

00:32:31.340   00:32:31.350  
or   the mother but what's so interesting
  

00:32:31.350   00:32:33.620  
or   the mother but what's so interesting 
   that  

00:32:33.620   00:32:33.630  
  about me to think well look isn't that
  

00:32:33.630   00:32:35.390  
  about me to think well look isn't that
cute     she's     it's  

00:32:35.390   00:32:35.400  
cute she's   imitating her mother it's
  

00:32:35.400   00:32:37.580  
cute she's   imitating her mother it's
like     that's     what  

00:32:37.580   00:32:37.590  
like no she's not   not what
  

00:32:37.590   00:32:40.190  
like no she's not   not what
happens     imitates  

00:32:40.190   00:32:40.200

know     pretty     could  

00:35:30.830   00:35:30.840  
know you're pretty   useless and I could
  

00:35:30.840   00:35:32.060  
know you're pretty   useless and I could
tear     throat     we

00:36:05.460   00:36:07.700  
is what we construct when we articulate
a     pattern    a  

00:36:07.700   00:36:07.710  
a behavioral pattern   right we observe a

a behavioral pattern   right we observe a
stable     we

stable behavioral pattern and when we

stable behavioral pattern and when we
articulate     call    but  

00:36:11.810   00:36:11.820  
articulate it we can call   it a rule but

articulate it we can call   it a rule but 
   just

   it's just

   it's just
a     we

human   especially in the in the
category    that

category   of ethics and I think that
that's     dangerous  

00:37:06.110   00:37:06.120  
that's well first of all it's dangerous
 

00:37:06.120   00:37:07.370  
that's well first of all it's dangerous
   are  

00:37:07.370   00:37:07.380  
  because that means that people are
  

00:37:07.380   00:37:09.620  
  because that means that people are
anything     into     and  

00:37:09.620   00:37:09.630  
   and
  

00:37:09.630   00:37:11.090  
   and
you     bloody     of

you bloody   of
  

00:37:11.100   00:37:13.070  
you bloody   of 
   just  

00:37:13.070   00:37:13.080  
  people who think that and second I just
  

00:37:13.080   00:37:14.600  
  people who think that and second I just 
   that's  

00:37:14.600   00:37:14.610  
   that's
  

00:37:14.610   00:37:17.240  
   that's
wrong     overwhelming     should  

00:37:17.240   00:37:17.250  
   we should
  

00:37:17.250   00:37:19.370  
   we should
just     thinking     the  

00:37:19.370   00:37:19.380  
just stop thinking   the
  

00:37:19.380   00:37:21.080  
just stop thinking   the
and     also  

00:37:21.080   00:37:21.090  
and that's   probably why I'm also
  

00:37:21.090   00:37:22.580  
and that's   probably why I'm also

so we need to   and so
well     here

  okay so the idea there at least in part

also    more  

00:38:03.680   00:38:03.690  
also   think there might be something more
  

00:38:03.690   00:38:05.540  
also   think there might be something more
approximately     about     well  

00:38:05.540   00:38:05.550  
approximately   that as well

approximately   that as well 
   know

   of the things we do know
there's     about     men

there's something   men

there's something   men 
   women  

00:38:13.610   00:38:13.620  
  men are much more criminal than women
  

00:38:13.620   00:38:15.860  
  men are much more criminal than women 
   look  

00:38:15.860   00:38:15.870  
   look
  

00:38:15.870   00:38:18.380  
   look 
   because  

00:38:18.380   00:38:18.390  
   because
  

00:38:18.390   00:38:20.660  
   because
it    in

it   Peaks when testosterone kicks in
  

00:38:20.670   00:38:21.590  
it   Peaks when testosterone kicks in

exactly   same thing it ramps up when
testosterone     and     starts

match     so

00:39:13.640   00:39:13.650  
it's the creativity   that
  

00:39:13.650   00:39:15.380  
it's the creativity   that
I'm     because  

00:39:15.380   00:39:15.390  
I'm particularly interested in because
 

00:39:15.390   00:39:18.230  
I'm particularly interested in because
the     many    it  

00:39:18.230   00:39:18.240  
the creativity is in many   ways it
  

00:39:18.240   00:39:21.040  
the creativity is in many   ways it 
   mean  

00:39:21.040   00:39:21.050  
  attributed youth and that's look I mean
  

00:39:21.050   00:39:23.900  
  attributed youth and that's look I mean
if     at     you've  

00:39:23.900   00:39:23.910  
if you look at   that sentence and you've
  

00:39:23.910   00:39:26.630  
if you look at   that sentence and you've
stripped     context  

00:39:26.630   00:39:26.640  
stripped it of   its religious context
  

00:39:26.640   00:39:29.120  
stripped it of   its religious context
what     is     the  

00:39:29.120   00:39:29.130  
what you would say is   that well the
  

00:39:29.130   00:39:32.170  
what you would say is   that well the
older    to  

00:39:32.170   00:39:32.180  
older   people use the younger people to
  

00:39:32.180   00:39:34.700  
older   people use the younger people to
generate     ideas     the  

00:39:34.700   00:39:34.710  
generate   and renew the
  

00:39:34.710   00:39:36.140  
generate   and renew the
world     like     what  

00:39:36.140   00:39:36.150  
world it's like   what
  

00:39:36.150   00:39:38.660  
world it's like   what
happens    have  

00:39:38.660   00:39:38.670  
happens   and you you know you also have
  

00:39:38.670   00:39:40.600  
happens   and you you know you also have
no    we  

00:39:40.600   00:39:40.610  
no   we
  

00:39:40.610   00:39:42.860  
no   we
discovered     beings  

00:39:42.860   00:39:42.870  
discovered or invented as human beings
 

00:39:42.870   00:39:44.900  
discovered or invented as human beings
were     and 

00:39:44.900   00:39:44.910  
were stumbled across by children and
 

00:39:44.910   00:39:46.820  
were stumbled across by children and
adolescence   they're  

00:39:46.820   00:39:46.830  
adolescence   you know because they're
  

00:39:46.830   00:39:49.340  
adolescence   you know because they're
well    exploratory  

00:39:49.340   00:39:49.350  
well   they're much more exploratory
  

00:39:49.350   00:39:51.440  
well   they're much more exploratory 
   by  

00:39:51.440   00:39:51.450  
  they're less constrained by their by
  

00:39:51.450   00:39:53.090  
  they're less constrained by their by
their     knowledge  

00:39:53.090   00:39:53.100  
their   already extent knowledge
  

00:39:53.100   00:39:54.890  
their   already extent knowledge
structures     conservative  

00:39:54.890   00:39:54.900  
structures and   they're less conservative
  

00:39:54.900   00:40:00.770  
structures and   they're less conservative 
   so  

00:40:00.770   00:40:00.780  
  so yeah that seems just right to me so
  

00:40:00.780   00:40:02.720  
  so yeah that seems just right to me so
and     extraordinarily  

00:40:02.720   00:40:02.730  
and   right in an extraordinarily
  

00:40:02.730   00:40:06.560  
and   right in an extraordinarily
important     that  

00:40:06.560   00:40:06.570  
important way because it also means that
 

00:40:06.570   00:40:09.380  
important way because it also means that
   one  

00:40:09.380   00:40:09.390  
   one
  

00:40:09.390   00:40:10.580  
   one
of     is     that  

00:40:10.580   00:40:10.590  
of   that
  

00:40:10.590   00:40:11.780  
of   that
that's     be  

00:40:11.780   00:40:11.790  
that's part of what you should   be
  

00:40:11.790   00:40:14.420  
that's part of what you should   be
encouraging     your     which  

00:40:14.420   00:40:14.430  
   son to do right which
  

00:40:14.430   00:40:16.910  
   son to do right which
is     which     is  

00:40:16.910   00:40:16.920  
is which   is does the rail of a father is
  

00:40:16.920   00:40:19.280  
is which   is does the rail of a father is
to     clearly     role  

00:40:19.280   00:40:19.290  
to encourage that is clearly   the role
  

00:40:19.290   00:40:20.990  
to encourage that is clearly   the role
and     to     out  

00:40:20.990   00:40:21.000  
and   say well go out
  

00:40:21.000   00:40:24.320  
and   say well go out 
   unknown  

00:40:24.320   00:40:24.330  
  there confront the chaos of the unknown
  

00:40:24.330   00:40:26.570  
  there confront the chaos of the unknown
and     everything  

00:40:26.570   00:40:26.580  
and the   chaos that underlies everything
  

00:40:26.580   00:40:28.850  
and the   chaos that underlies everything 
   because  

00:40:28.850   00:40:28.860  
   how because
  

00:40:28.860   00:40:31.160  
   how because 
   chaos  

00:40:31.160   00:40:31.170  
  you can do it here as big as the chaos
  

00:40:31.170   00:40:33.020  
  you can do it here as big as the chaos
itself     useful  

00:40:33.020   00:40:33.030  
itself and you know do something useful
 

00:40:33.030   00:40:35.030  
itself and you know do something useful
as     consequence    life  

00:40:35.030   00:40:35.040

   make everyone else's life
better     you     and  

00:40:38.150   00:40:38.160  
   and
  

00:40:38.160   00:40:39.800  
   and
man     tell  

00:40:39.800   00:40:39.810  
man that's   the right thing to tell
  

00:40:39.810   00:40:41.810  
man that's   the right thing to tell
that's     men  

00:40:41.810   00:40:41.820  
that's   the right thing to tell young men
  

00:40:41.820   00:40:43.670  
that's   the right thing to tell young men
you     more  

00:40:43.670   00:40:43.680  
you know talking to   young women is more
  

00:40:43.680   00:40:45.580  
you know talking to   young women is more 
   more  

00:40:45.580   00:40:45.590  
  complicated because they have more more
  

00:40:45.590   00:40:48.020  
  complicated because they have more more
let's     because  

00:40:48.020   00:40:48.030  
let's say issues to deal with   because
  

00:40:48.030   00:40:49.970  
let's say issues to deal with   because 
   some  

00:40:49.970   00:40:49.980  
   complicated in some
  

00:40:49.980   00:40:51.710  
   complicated in some
ways     definitely     right  

00:40:51.710   00:40:51.720  
ways but that's definitely   the right
  

00:40:51.720   00:40:54.380  
ways but that's definitely   the right 
   son  

00:40:54.380   00:40:54.390  
  thing to be to be telling your your son
  

00:40:54.390   00:40:56.570  
  thing to be to be telling your your son 
   really  

00:40:56.570   00:40:56.580  
  and one of the things that I've really
  

00:40:56.580   00:40:58.010  
  and one of the things that I've really
noticed    been  

00:40:58.010   00:40:58.020  
noticed   recently since I've been
  

00:40:58.020   00:40:59.660  
noticed   recently since I've been 
   seven  

00:40:59.660   00:40:59.670  
  lecturing especially in the last seven
  

00:40:59.670   00:41:01.130  
  lecturing especially in the last seven
or    audiences  

00:41:01.130   00:41:01.140  
or   eight months most of my audiences
  

00:41:01.140   00:41:03.410  
or   eight months most of my audiences
being     a  

00:41:03.410   00:41:03.420  
being young men and and I've talked a
 

00:41:03.420   00:41:06.050  
being young men and and I've talked a
lot   lot  

00:41:06.050   00:41:06.060  
lot   I've talked a lot
  

00:41:06.060   00:41:07.670  
lot   I've talked a lot
to     truth     and  

00:41:07.670   00:41:07.680  
to   and
  

00:41:07.680   00:41:09.920  
to   and
responsibility     those  

00:41:09.920   00:41:09.930  
responsibility and I think   that those
  

00:41:09.930   00:41:11.510  
responsibility and I think   that those
those     are     underlie  

00:41:11.510   00:41:11.520  
those   the two things that underlie
  

00:41:11.520   00:41:15.080  
those   the two things that underlie
this     to     me  

00:41:15.080   00:41:15.090  
this   me
  

00:41:15.090   00:41:17.030  
this   me 
   idea  

00:41:17.030   00:41:17.040  
   be a tremendous hunger for that idea
  

00:41:17.040   00:41:19.610  
   be a tremendous hunger for that idea 
   know  

00:41:19.610   00:41:19.620  
   you know
  

00:41:19.620   00:41:21.410  
   you know
it's     a  

00:41:21.410   00:41:21.420  
it's   very different ideas it's a
  

00:41:21.420   00:41:23.930  
it's   very different ideas it's a
counterpart     you  

00:41:23.930   00:41:23.940  
counterpart to   right and so it's you
  

00:41:23.940   00:41:27.350  
counterpart to   right and so it's you
know     is     it's  

00:41:27.350   00:41:27.360  
know life is   it's
  

00:41:27.360   00:41:29.330  
know life is   it's
difficult     definitely     a  

00:41:29.330   00:41:29.340  
difficult it's really   a
  

00:41:29.340   00:41:31.640  
difficult it's really   a
challenge    shrink  

00:41:31.640   00:41:31.650  
challenge   and so you can either shrink
  

00:41:31.650   00:41:33.530  
challenge   and so you can either shrink 
   because  

00:41:33.530   00:41:33.540  
   wonder because
  

00:41:33.540   00:41:35.570  
   wonder because 
   not  

00:41:35.570   00:41:35.580  
  you know it's going to kill you it's not
  

00:41:35.580   00:41:39.050  
  you know it's going to kill you it's not 
   can  

00:41:39.050   00:41:39.060  
   where you can
  

00:41:39.060   00:41:40.790  
   where you can
front     about  

00:41:40.790   00:41:40.800  
front it and try to do something   about
  

00:41:40.800   00:41:43.490  
front it and try to do something   about
it     you  

00:41:43.490   00:41:43.500  
  it well what's better and and then you
  

00:41:43.500   00:41:45.050  
  it well what's better and and then you
say     person     do  

00:41:45.050   00:41:45.060  
say   look man you could do
  

00:41:45.060   00:41:46.400  
say   look man you could do
it     human     is  

00:41:46.400   00:41:46.410  
it   is
  

00:41:46.410   00:41:48.890  
it   is
like     got  

00:41:48.890   00:41:48.900  
like   and if you just stood up and got
  

00:41:48.900   00:41:52.010  
like   and if you just stood up and got
yourself     together     by  

00:41:52.010   00:41:52.020  
yourself   and you find out by
  

00:41:52.020   00:41:54.350  
yourself   and you find out by
trying     fact     and  

00:41:54.350   00:41:54.360  
trying that you can in fact   and
  

00:41:54.360   00:41:56.690  
trying that you can in fact   and
I     great  

00:41:56.690   00:41:56.700  
I do think   that that's that's a great
  

00:41:56.700   00:41:58.940  
I do think   that that's that's a great
core     can  

00:41:58.940   00:41:58.950  
core religious message as   far as I can
  

00:41:58.950   00:42:00.200  
core religious message as   far as I can 
   embedded  

00:42:00.200   00:42:00.210  
  tell and I think that's deeply embedded
  

00:42:00.210   00:42:03.790  
  tell and I think that's deeply embedded 
   so  

00:42:03.790   00:42:03.800  
  in this sort of in this sort of idea so
  

00:42:03.800   00:42:05.750  
  in this sort of in this sort of idea so 
   been  

00:42:05.750   00:42:05.760  
   is what I've been
  

00:42:05.760   00:42:07.970  
   is what I've been 
   how  

00:42:07.970   00:42:07.980  
   something like how
  

00:42:07.980   00:42:12.440  
   something like how
knowledge     of  

00:42:12.440   00:42:12.450  
knowledge   itself is generated first of
  

00:42:12.450   00:42:14.240  
knowledge   itself is generated first of
all     as  

00:42:14.240   00:42:14.250  
all there's the unknown as
 

00:42:14.250   00:42:15.530  
all there's the unknown as
and     know 

00:42:15.530   00:42:15.540  
and that's really what you don't know
 

00:42:15.540   00:42:17.570  
and that's really what you don't know
   you  

00:42:17.570   00:42:17.580  
  anything about and generally when you
  

00:42:17.580   00:42:19.580  
  anything about and generally when you
encounter     that     it  

00:42:19.580   00:42:19.590  
encounter that   you don't encounter it

that     human

occupy   this weird cognitive niche and so
  

00:43:39.690   00:43:40.940  
occupy   this weird cognitive niche and so
one     of     that  

00:43:40.940   00:43:40.950  
one of   is that
  

00:43:40.950   00:43:44.240  
one of   is that

   it is there's a massive

   it is there's a massive 
   so  

00:43:49.460   00:43:49.470  
   and so
  

00:43:49.470   00:43:53.630  
   and so
that     right     as  

00:43:53.630   00:43:53.640  
that seems   it's true as
  

00:43:53.640   00:43:55.520  
that seems   it's true as 
   say  

00:43:55.520   00:43:55.530  
  anything is and then I would also say
  

00:43:55.530   00:43:58.280  
  anything is and then I would also say
that    of  

00:43:58.280   00:43:58.290  
that   we know that one of
  

00:43:58.290   00:44:00.260

yeah   that's the other thing and so
  

00:44:23.730   00:44:25.520  
yeah   that's the other thing and so
there's     this     came  

00:44:25.520   00:44:25.530  
there's this   that I think came
  

00:44:25.530   00:44:27.430  
there's this   that I think came
probably     Mesopotamia  

00:44:27.430   00:44:27.440  
probably came from the Mesopotamia
 

00:44:27.440   00:44:29.650  
probably came from the Mesopotamia

the     terrible  

00:44:33.850   00:44:33.860  
the thing that confronts   this terrible
  

00:44:33.860   00:44:35.680  
the thing that confronts   this terrible 
   chaotic  

00:44:35.680   00:44:35.690  
   that represents the chaotic
  

00:44:35.690   00:44:38.440  
   that represents the chaotic
unknown     then  

00:44:38.440   00:44:38.450  
unknown and cuts it into   pieces and then
  

00:44:38.450   00:44:40.450  
unknown and cuts it into   pieces and then
sometimes     parts     the  

00:44:40.450   00:44:40.460  
sometimes gives the body parts   to the
  

00:44:40.460   00:44:42.430  
sometimes gives the body parts   to the 
   you  

00:44:42.430   00:44:42.440  
  populace in order to feed them so you
  

00:44:42.440   00:44:44.020  
  populace in order to feed them so you
can     well  

00:44:44.020   00:44:44.030  
can see a hunting metaphor there as well
 

00:44:44.030   00:44:45.340  
can see a hunting metaphor there as well
   that  

00:44:45.340   00:44:45.350  
   than that
  

00:44:45.350   00:44:49.480  
   than that 
   is  

00:44:49.480   00:44:49.490  
   all right so the first thing is
  

00:44:49.490   00:44:51.100  
   all right so the first thing is
there's     the  

00:44:51.100   00:44:51.110  
there's the absolute unknown and the
 

00:44:51.110   00:44:52.960  
there's the absolute unknown and the
unknown     is    understand  

00:44:52.960   00:44:52.970  
unknown is   what you do not understand
  

00:44:52.970   00:44:54.820  
unknown is   what you do not understand
it's     campfire     maybe  

00:44:54.820   00:44:54.830  
it's what's beyond the campfire   maybe
  

00:44:54.830   00:44:57.190  
it's what's beyond the campfire   maybe
it's     even     more

this notion about   is

the    our  

00:45:48.820   00:45:48.830  
the   first thing we do is we act out our
  

00:45:48.830   00:45:51.310  
the   first thing we do is we act out our
encounter     with     we

encounter   world and we
  

00:45:51.320   00:45:53.590  
encounter   world and we
act     that     manner  

00:45:53.590   00:45:53.600  
act   way in a manner
  

00:45:53.600   00:45:55.300  
act   way in a manner 
   that's  

00:45:55.300   00:45:55.310  
   the manner that's
  

00:45:55.310   00:45:58.060  
   the manner that's
presented     what     is  

00:45:58.060   00:45:58.070  
presented as a description of what   it is
  

00:45:58.070   00:45:59.650  
presented as a description of what   it is 
   time

   chaos  

00:46:01.330   00:46:01.340  
  to extract habitable order out of chaos
  

00:46:01.340   00:46:04.930  
  to extract habitable order out of chaos 
   other  

00:46:04.930   00:46:04.940  
   I I will tell you about the other
  

00:46:04.940   00:46:07.240  
   I I will tell you about the other
part     of     out  

00:46:07.240   00:46:07.250  
part of   that for now so you act it out
  

00:46:07.250   00:46:10.750  
part of   that for now so you act it out
first     and     you  

00:46:10.750   00:46:10.760  
first   then the second thing is you
  

00:46:10.760   00:46:12.550  
first   then the second thing is you
watch     it     you  

00:46:12.550   00:46:12.560  
watch people   out and you
  

00:46:12.560   00:46:14.530  
watch people   out and you
start     that  

00:46:14.530   00:46:14.540  
  start to make representations of that
  

00:46:14.540   00:46:16.450  
  start to make representations of that
that's     you  

00:46:16.450   00:46:16.460  
that's stories right and maybe you
 

00:46:16.460   00:46:18.460  
that's stories right and maybe you
admire     them    time  

00:46:18.460   00:46:18.470  
admire them   and then after a long time
  

00:46:18.470   00:46:20.140  
admire them   and then after a long time
you     a     and  

00:46:20.140   00:46:20.150  
you   bunch of those stories and
  

00:46:20.150   00:46:22.150  
you   bunch of those stories and
then     can  

00:46:22.150   00:46:22.160  
then you can say what that   is you can
  

00:46:22.160   00:46:24.520  
then you can say what that   is you can
articulate     and  

00:46:24.520   00:46:24.530  
articulate   it as a pattern and so and
  

00:46:24.530   00:46:26.320  
articulate   it as a pattern and so and
this    figured  

00:46:26.320   00:46:26.330  
this   is something Nietzsche also figured
  

00:46:26.330   00:46:28.450  
this   is something Nietzsche also figured
out     prior  

00:46:28.450   00:46:28.460  
out to begin   with you know because prior
  

00:46:28.460   00:46:30.850  
out to begin   with you know because prior
to     many  

00:46:30.850   00:46:30.860  
  to Nietzsche I would say he did so many
  

00:46:30.860   00:46:33.160  
  to Nietzsche I would say he did so many
things     you  

00:46:33.160   00:46:33.170  
things first it was quite remarkable   you
  

00:46:33.170   00:46:35.530  
things first it was quite remarkable   you
know     first  

00:46:35.530   00:46:35.540  
know there was an idea that you first
 

00:46:35.540   00:46:37.750  
know there was an idea that you first
think   people  

00:46:37.750   00:46:37.760  
think   you act and then people
  

00:46:37.760   00:46:40.280  
think   you act and then people 
   it  

00:46:40.280   00:46:40.290  
   course you do it
  

00:46:40.290   00:46:42.620  
   course you do it 
   impulsive  

00:46:42.620   00:46:42.630  
   impulsive
  

00:46:42.630   00:46:44.690  
   impulsive
as     can     you're  

00:46:44.690   00:46:44.700  
   possibly imagine you're
  

00:46:44.700   00:46:46.430  
   possibly imagine you're
always     things     and  

00:46:46.430   00:46:46.440  
always doing things   before you think and
  

00:46:46.440   00:46:48.440  
always doing things   before you think and
sometimes    so  

00:46:48.440   00:46:48.450  
sometimes   so
  

00:46:48.450   00:46:50.180  
sometimes   so
the     see     then  

00:46:50.180   00:46:50.190  
the idea that you see   things and then
  

00:46:50.190   00:46:52.040  
the idea that you see   things and then
think     really  

00:46:52.040   00:46:52.050  
think   and then act it's like you really
  

00:46:52.050   00:46:55.340  
think   and then act it's like you really 
   I  

00:46:55.340   00:46:55.350  
  know I'm sorry did I don't do that I
  

00:46:55.350   00:46:58.190  
  know I'm sorry did I don't do that I 
   and  

00:46:58.190   00:46:58.200  
   and
  

00:46:58.200   00:46:59.690  
   and
they     certainly     that  

00:46:59.690   00:46:59.700  
they certainly   that
  

00:46:59.700   00:47:01.490  
they certainly   that
when     emotional     act  

00:47:01.490   00:47:01.500  
when they're emotional   you act
  

00:47:01.500   00:47:03.200  
when they're emotional   you act
first    that  

00:47:03.200   00:47:03.210  
first   and one of the things that
  

00:47:03.210   00:47:05.170  
first   and one of the things that
Nietzsche     our  

00:47:05.170   00:47:05.180  
Nietzsche   said very clearly was that our
  

00:47:05.180   00:47:07.940  
Nietzsche   said very clearly was that our
ideas     of     our  

00:47:07.940   00:47:07.950  
ideas emerged out of   the ground of our
  

00:47:07.950   00:47:10.040  
ideas emerged out of   the ground of our
action     and     thousands  

00:47:10.040   00:47:10.050  
action over over thousands and   thousands
  

00:47:10.050   00:47:11.750  
action over over thousands and   thousands
of     were  

00:47:11.750   00:47:11.760  
of years and then when philosophers were
 

00:47:11.760   00:47:14.030  
of years and then when philosophers were
putting     forward    they  

00:47:14.030   00:47:14.040  
putting forward   those ideas what they
  

00:47:14.040   00:47:16.640  
putting forward   those ideas what they
were     creative  

00:47:16.640   00:47:16.650  
were doing wasn't generating creative
 

00:47:16.650   00:47:19.490  
were doing wasn't generating creative
ideas     just    story  

00:47:19.490   00:47:19.500  
ideas they were just   story
  

00:47:19.500   00:47:22.550  
ideas they were just   story 
   it's  

00:47:22.550   00:47:22.560  
   already there it's
  

00:47:22.560   00:47:24.710  
   already there it's
already     our  

00:47:24.710   00:47:24.720  
already in us it's   already in our
  

00:47:24.720   00:47:27.380  
already in us it's   already in our
patterns     strikes  

00:47:27.380   00:47:27.390  
patterns of behavior and and it strikes
 

00:47:27.390   00:47:31.130  
patterns of behavior and and it strikes
me     that    and  

00:47:31.130   00:47:31.140  
me that   that's well he was a genius and
  

00:47:31.140   00:47:33.370  
me that   that's well he was a genius and 
   his  

00:47:33.370   00:47:33.380  
  that was one of the genius one of his
  

00:47:33.380   00:47:36.080  
  that was one of the genius one of his
many    genius  

00:47:36.080   00:47:36.090  
many   many observations of pure genius
  

00:47:36.090   00:47:37.910  
many   many observations of pure genius 
   know  

00:47:37.910   00:47:37.920  
   think about it you know
  

00:47:37.920   00:47:39.470  
   think about it you know 
   is  

00:47:39.470   00:47:39.480  
   too is
  

00:47:39.480   00:47:42.500  
   too is
that     in  

00:47:42.500   00:47:42.510  
that there's unknown and then you act in
 

00:47:42.510   00:47:44.270  
that there's unknown and then you act in
the   you  

00:47:44.270   00:47:44.280  
the   of the unknown and then you you
  

00:47:44.280   00:47:46.520  
the   of the unknown and then you you
dream     about     what  

00:47:46.520   00:47:46.530  
dream about   the action and that's what
  

00:47:46.530   00:47:48.590  
dream about   the action and that's what
you're     doing     then  

00:47:48.590   00:47:48.600  
you're doing   theater and then
  

00:47:48.600   00:47:51.800  
you're doing   theater and then
you     and  

00:47:51.800   00:47:51.810  
you speak   about it and so you know and
  

00:47:51.810   00:47:53.300  
you speak   about it and so you know and
of     that  

00:47:53.300   00:47:53.310  
of course   once you speak about it that
  

00:47:53.310   00:47:54.890  
of course   once you speak about it that
affects     dream  

00:47:54.890   00:47:54.900  
affects how you dream and   how you dream
  

00:47:54.900   00:47:57.140  
affects how you dream and   how you dream
affects     the  

00:47:57.140   00:47:57.150  
affects how you act   it's not like the
  

00:47:57.150   00:47:59.750  
affects how you act   it's not like the
all    was  

00:47:59.750   00:47:59.760  
all   of the causal direction is it was
  

00:47:59.760   00:48:01.430  
all   of the causal direction is it was
one    these  

00:48:01.430   00:48:01.440  
one   way because it's not deep these
  

00:48:01.440   00:48:03.980  
one   way because it's not deep these
things     the  

00:48:03.980   00:48:03.990  
things loop but it's still from the
 

00:48:03.990   00:48:05.780  
things loop but it's still from the
unknown     through    the  

00:48:05.780   00:48:05.790  
unknown through the body through   the
  

00:48:05.790   00:48:08.180  
unknown through the body through   the
imagination    the  

00:48:08.180   00:48:08.190  
imagination   into articulation that's the
  

00:48:08.190   00:48:10.130  
imagination   into articulation that's the 
   of  

00:48:10.130   00:48:10.140  
  primary mode of the generation of of
  

00:48:10.140   00:48:12.740  
  primary mode of the generation of of
wisdom     map  

00:48:12.740   00:48:12.750  
wisdom let's say and you   can easily map
  

00:48:12.750   00:48:14.740  
wisdom let's say and you   can easily map
that    explanation  

00:48:14.740   00:48:14.750  
that   onto an evolutionary explanation
  

00:48:14.750   00:48:17.690  
that   onto an evolutionary explanation 
   and  

00:48:17.690   00:48:17.700  
  because the body comes first right and
  

00:48:17.700   00:48:20.060  
  because the body comes first right and
then     the  

00:48:20.060   00:48:20.070  
then is the imagination   which is the
  

00:48:20.070   00:48:22.520  
then is the imagination   which is the
body     in     the  

00:48:22.520   00:48:22.530  
body in   abstraction and only then the
  

00:48:22.530   00:48:24.530  
body in   abstraction and only then the
word     that's     how  

00:48:24.530   00:48:24.540  
word and of course that's   exactly how
  

00:48:24.540   00:48:26.360  
word and of course that's   exactly how
things     evolve     could  

00:48:26.360   00:48:26.370  
things did evolve   because we could
  

00:48:26.370   00:48:28.970  
things did evolve   because we could
imagine     could  

00:48:28.970   00:48:28.980  
imagine things   long before we could
  

00:48:28.980   00:48:32.750  
imagine things   long before we could 
   and  

00:48:32.750   00:48:32.760  
   so and
  

00:48:32.760   00:48:37.430  
   so and
I     represented     from  

00:48:37.430   00:48:37.440  
I represented   that this is a image from
  

00:48:37.440   00:48:40.250  
I represented   that this is a image from 
   the  

00:48:40.250   00:48:40.260  
  my book maps of meaning and so so the
  

00:48:40.260   00:48:42.350  
  my book maps of meaning and so so the
idea    fundamental  

00:48:42.350   00:48:42.360  
idea   is the fundamental
  

00:48:42.360   00:48:44.780  
idea   is the fundamental 
   such  

00:48:44.780   00:48:44.790  
  representation of the unknown as such
  

00:48:44.790   00:48:47.450  
  representation of the unknown as such
it's     of  

00:48:47.450   00:48:47.460  
it's half   spirit because it partakes of
  

00:48:47.460   00:48:49.640  
it's half   spirit because it partakes of
the     bird     matter  

00:48:49.640   00:48:49.650  
the air like a bird   and it's half matter
  

00:48:49.650   00:48:51.800  
the air like a bird   and it's half matter
because     a  

00:48:51.800   00:48:51.810  
because it's on the ground   like a like a
  

00:48:51.810   00:48:52.600  
because it's on the ground   like a like a
like     a

like a
 

00:48:52.610   00:48:55.990  
like a
make     think    is  

00:48:55.990   00:48:56.000  
make and and that's what you think   is
  

00:48:56.000   00:48:57.610  
make and and that's what you think   is
there     there  

00:48:57.610   00:48:57.620  
there when   you don't know what is there
  

00:48:57.620   00:48:59.710  
there when   you don't know what is there
that's     what's  

00:48:59.710   00:48:59.720  
that's how your body reacts to   what's
  

00:48:59.720   00:49:01.090  
that's how your body reacts to   what's
there     there

there when you   don't know what is there
  

00:49:01.100   00:49:03.040  
there when you   don't know what is there
you     that     you're  

00:49:03.040   00:49:03.050  
you   because if you're
  

00:49:03.050   00:49:05.920  
you   because if you're
alone     you're  

00:49:05.920   00:49:05.930  
alone at night   you know it maybe you're
  

00:49:05.930   00:49:07.330  
alone at night   you know it maybe you're
a    other

a   up for one reason other
  

00:49:07.340   00:49:09.040  
a   up for one reason other
maybe     you  

00:49:09.040   00:49:09.050  
maybe   you watched a horror movie and you
  

00:49:09.050   00:49:10.510  
maybe   you watched a horror movie and you
know     the  

00:49:10.510   00:49:10.520  
know there's some weird noise in the
 

00:49:10.520   00:49:12.760  
know there's some weird noise in the
other   just  

00:49:12.760   00:49:12.770  
other   room it's dark and you could just
  

00:49:12.770   00:49:14.710  
other   room it's dark and you could just
try     on  

00:49:14.710   00:49:14.720  
try this once it's like so you're on
 

00:49:14.720   00:49:15.250  
try this once it's like so you're on
edge

00:49:15.250   00:49:15.260  
edge
 

00:49:15.260   00:49:17.500  
edge
you     want    on  

00:49:17.500   00:49:17.510  
you think you want   to turn the light on
  

00:49:17.510   00:49:19.330

00:49:19.340   00:49:20.530  
and   and see don't do that
just     and  

00:49:20.530   00:49:20.540  
just open the door a   little bit and
  

00:49:20.540   00:49:22.870  
just open the door a   little bit and
sneak     what  

00:49:22.870   00:49:22.880  
  sneak your hand in and just watch what

your   imagination fills that room with
right     what  

00:49:27.640   00:49:27.650  
right and then then   you remember what
  

00:49:27.650   00:49:29.290  
right and then then   you remember what
it's     bed  

00:49:29.290   00:49:29.300  
it's   like to be three years old in bed
  

00:49:29.300   00:49:30.520  
it's   like to be three years old in bed 
   dark  

00:49:30.520   00:49:30.530  
   afraid of the dark
  

00:49:30.530   00:49:32.740  
   afraid of the dark
right     dragons  

00:49:32.740   00:49:32.750  
right and I read a good book   on dragons
  

00:49:32.750   00:49:35.860  
right and I read a good book   on dragons
lately    a  

00:49:35.860   00:49:35.870  
lately   had a
  

00:49:35.870   00:49:37.690  
lately   had a 
   I  

00:49:37.690   00:49:37.700  
   about them I
  

00:49:37.700   00:49:39.400  
   about them I
thought     of     did  

00:49:39.400   00:49:39.410  
thought one of   the things the guy did
  

00:49:39.410   00:49:41.470  
thought one of   the things the guy did 
   name  

00:49:41.470   00:49:41.480  
   name
  

00:49:41.480   00:49:44.530  
   name
unfortunately    image  

00:49:44.530   00:49:44.540  
unfortunately   track how common the image
  

00:49:44.540   00:49:45.970  
unfortunately   track how common the image
of     it's  

00:49:45.970   00:49:45.980  
of the   dragon was worldwide it's
  

00:49:45.980   00:49:48.340  
of the   dragon was worldwide it's
unbelievably     crazily  

00:49:48.340   00:49:48.350  
unbelievably widespread it's crazily
 

00:49:48.350   00:49:51.100  
unbelievably widespread it's crazily
widespread     thought    was  

00:49:51.100   00:49:51.110  
widespread and he thought   that this was
  

00:49:51.110   00:49:54.180  
widespread and he thought   that this was
actually     category     primate  

00:49:54.180   00:49:54.190  
actually the category   of primate
  

00:49:54.190   00:49:57.850  
actually the category   of primate
predator     so  

00:49:57.850   00:49:57.860  
predator and the predator was so
 

00:49:57.860   00:49:59.530  
predator and the predator was so
predator     right 

00:49:59.530   00:49:59.540  
predator is a weird category right
 

00:49:59.540   00:50:01.180  
predator is a weird category right
because     like    crocodiles  

00:50:01.180   00:50:01.190  
because like   there's there's crocodiles
  

00:50:01.190   00:50:02.740  
because like   there's there's crocodiles
in     lions     don't  

00:50:02.740   00:50:02.750  
in it and there's lions   and they don't
  

00:50:02.750   00:50:04.210  
in it and there's lions   and they don't
have     you  

00:50:04.210   00:50:04.220  
have much in   common except they eat you
  

00:50:04.220   00:50:06.520  
have much in   common except they eat you
so     so  

00:50:06.520   00:50:06.530  
so it's a functional category and so
 

00:50:06.530   00:50:08.470  
so it's a functional category and so
this     is    imagistic  

00:50:08.470   00:50:08.480  
this is the this is   the imagistic
  

00:50:08.480   00:50:10.180  
this is the this is   the imagistic
representation     functional  

00:50:10.180   00:50:10.190  
representation of the functional
 

00:50:10.190   00:50:12.280  
representation of the functional
category     predator 

00:50:12.280   00:50:12.290  
category of predator and his predator
 

00:50:12.290   00:50:14.200  
category of predator and his predator
theory     well    then  

00:50:14.200   00:50:14.210  
theory was well   monkey then
  

00:50:14.210   00:50:16.360  
theory was well   monkey then 
   eagle  

00:50:16.360   00:50:16.370  
   like an eagle
  

00:50:16.370   00:50:21.970  
   like an eagle
and     it  

00:50:21.970   00:50:21.980  
and so that's this right and then if it
 

00:50:21.980   00:50:23.680  
and so that's this right and then if it
wasn't     climb 

00:50:23.680   00:50:23.690  
wasn't eagle it was a cat as they climb
 

00:50:23.690   00:50:25.390  
wasn't eagle it was a cat as they climb
   chomping  

00:50:25.390   00:50:25.400  
  teary trees and give you a good chomping
  

00:50:25.400   00:50:27.670  
  teary trees and give you a good chomping 
   go  

00:50:27.670   00:50:27.680  
   go
  

00:50:27.680   00:50:29.080  
   go 
   get  

00:50:29.080   00:50:29.090  
   would get
  

00:50:29.090   00:50:30.490  
   would get
you     climb     the  

00:50:30.490   00:50:30.500  
you or maybe a snake would climb   the
  

00:50:30.500   00:50:31.840  
you or maybe a snake would climb   the
tree     to     and  

00:50:31.840   00:50:31.850  
tree because snakes like to   do that and
  

00:50:31.850   00:50:36.630  
tree because snakes like to   do that and
get     a     snake  

00:50:36.630   00:50:36.640  
get you and so   pre cat snake
  

00:50:36.640   00:50:40.030  
get you and so   pre cat snake 
   that's  

00:50:40.030   00:50:40.040  
  basically free cat snake bird and that's
  

00:50:40.040   00:50:42.220  
  basically free cat snake bird and that's
the     you     thing  

00:50:42.220   00:50:42.230  
the thing   really that's the thing
  

00:50:42.230   00:50:43.540  
the thing   really that's the thing 
   don't  

00:50:43.540   00:50:43.550  
  you're really want to avoid you don't
  

00:50:43.550   00:50:44.830  
  you're really want to avoid you don't
want     across     so  

00:50:44.830   00:50:44.840  
want to come across   and so
  

00:50:44.840   00:50:46.720  
want to come across   and so 
   it  

00:50:46.720   00:50:46.730  
   know the other thing it
  

00:50:46.730   00:50:48.250  
   know the other thing it
does    quite  

00:50:48.250   00:50:48.260  
does   breathe fire which is quite
  

00:50:48.260   00:50:50.590  
does   breathe fire which is quite 
   was  

00:50:50.590   00:50:50.600  
   obviously fire was
  

00:50:50.600   00:50:52.870  
   obviously fire was
both     enemy  

00:50:52.870   00:50:52.880  
both greatest friend and greatest enemy
 

00:50:52.880   00:50:54.970  
both greatest friend and greatest enemy
   for  

00:50:54.970   00:50:54.980  
   fire for
  

00:50:54.980   00:50:56.440  
   fire for
a     as     two  

00:50:56.440   00:50:56.450  
a long   two
  

00:50:56.450   00:50:57.970  
a long   two
or     three     years  

00:50:57.970   00:50:57.980  
or   million years
  

00:50:57.980   00:51:00.640  
or   million years
that's     Richard     think  

00:51:00.640   00:51:00.650  
that's what   rang him I think
  

00:51:00.650   00:51:02.890  
that's what   rang him I think 
   recently  

00:51:02.890   00:51:02.900  
   he wrote a book recently
  

00:51:02.900   00:51:05.430  
   he wrote a book recently
on     Ragan  

00:51:05.430   00:51:05.440  
on   I think it was Ragan
  

00:51:05.440   00:51:06.839  
on   I think it was Ragan
who     wrote     beings  

00:51:06.839   00:51:06.849  
who wrote   on when human beings
  

00:51:06.849   00:51:08.730  
who wrote   on when human beings 
   two  

00:51:08.730   00:51:08.740  
   that was about two
  

00:51:08.740   00:51:10.950  
   that was about two

   they're
  

00:51:18.160   00:51:19.650  
   they're
ugly     shaped     bowling  

00:51:19.650   00:51:19.660  
ugly   like a big bowling
  

00:51:19.660   00:51:21.300  
ugly   like a big bowling
ball     they're     look

like the   unknown unknowns that who's the 
   I  

00:53:39.870   00:53:39.880  
   yeah I
  

00:53:39.880   00:53:41.460  
   yeah I
think     that     caught  

00:53:41.460   00:53:41.470  
think   phrase caught
  

00:53:41.470   00:53:43.020  
think   phrase caught
on     an  

00:53:43.020   00:53:43.030  
on so well is because   he nailed an
  

00:53:43.030   00:53:43.680  
on so well is because   he nailed an
archetype 

00:53:43.680   00:53:43.690  
archetype
 

00:53:43.690   00:53:45.510  
archetype
there's     there's 

00:53:45.510   00:53:45.520  
there's unknown unknowns and there's
 

00:53:45.520   00:53:47.340  
there's unknown unknowns and there's
known     unknowns    unknown  

00:53:47.340   00:53:47.350  
known unknowns   and that's the unknown
  

00:53:47.350   00:53:49.920  
known unknowns   and that's the unknown 
   react  

00:53:49.920   00:53:49.930  
   to react
  

00:53:49.930   00:53:51.780  
   to react 
   can  

00:53:51.780   00:53:51.790  
   because they can
  

00:53:51.790   00:53:53.910  
   because they can
get     plead  

00:53:53.910   00:53:53.920  
get you and you can't just   plead
  

00:53:53.920   00:53:55.500  
get you and you can't just   plead
ignorance     dead     that  

00:53:55.500   00:53:55.510  
ignorance because then you're dead   that
  

00:53:55.510   00:53:57.480  
ignorance because then you're dead   that
doesn't     are     the  

00:53:57.480   00:53:57.490  
doesn't work   the
  

00:53:57.490   00:53:59.310  
doesn't work   the
sort     to  

00:53:59.310   00:53:59.320  
sort of creature who has to know   what to
  

00:53:59.320   00:54:01.440  
sort of creature who has to know   what to
do     and  

00:54:01.440   00:54:01.450  
do when they don't   know what to do and
  

00:54:01.450   00:54:03.120  
do when they don't   know what to do and
that's     do  

00:54:03.120   00:54:03.130  
that's very paradoxical   and what we do
  

00:54:03.130   00:54:05.100  
that's very paradoxical   and what we do
is     prepare     that's  

00:54:05.100   00:54:05.110  
is we prepare   that's
  

00:54:05.110   00:54:06.600  
is we prepare   that's
right     we're     do  

00:54:06.600   00:54:06.610  
right we're   on guard we prepare to do
  

00:54:06.610   00:54:08.850  
right we're   on guard we prepare to do
everything    but  

00:54:08.850   00:54:08.860  
everything   very stressful and but
  

00:54:08.860   00:54:11.130  
everything   very stressful and but
also     very     much  

00:54:11.130   00:54:11.140  
also very engaging and   much
  

00:54:11.140   00:54:12.660  
also very engaging and   much
something    consciousness  

00:54:12.660   00:54:12.670  
something   that heightens consciousness
  

00:54:12.670   00:54:14.880  
something   that heightens consciousness 
   permanently  

00:54:14.880   00:54:14.890  
  and maybe those circuits are permanently
  

00:54:14.890   00:54:16.380  
  and maybe those circuits are permanently
turned     because     we  

00:54:16.380   00:54:16.390  
turned on in human   we
  

00:54:16.390   00:54:18.240  
turned on in human   we
also     that     no  

00:54:18.240   00:54:18.250  
also know that   and no
  

00:54:18.250   00:54:20.250  
also know that   and no
other     sometimes  

00:54:20.250   00:54:20.260  
other animal knows that and so   sometimes
  

00:54:20.260   00:54:22.170  
other animal knows that and so   sometimes
I    stress  

00:54:22.170   00:54:22.180

00:54:22.180   00:54:24.240  
I   think that our that our stress
circuits     and  

00:54:24.240   00:54:24.250  
circuits are just on all the time and
 

00:54:24.250   00:54:25.710  
circuits are just on all the time and
that's     accounts    our  

00:54:25.710   00:54:25.720  
that's part of what accounts   for our

that's part of what accounts   for our 
   have  

00:54:28.020   00:54:28.030  
   so you have
  

00:54:28.030   00:54:29.610  
   so you have 
   have  

00:54:29.610   00:54:29.620  
  your unknown unknowns and then you have
  

00:54:29.620   00:54:32.340  
  your unknown unknowns and then you have
your     unknowns  

00:54:32.340   00:54:32.350  
your relatively you have the unknowns
 

00:54:32.350   00:54:34.260  
your relatively you have the unknowns
that   world  

00:54:34.260   00:54:34.270  
that   you actually encounter in the world
  

00:54:34.270   00:54:37.400  
that   you actually encounter in the world
like     of     your  

00:54:37.400   00:54:37.410  
like the mystery of your   your
  

00:54:37.410   00:54:39.450  
like the mystery of your   your

00:54:43.120   00:54:44.790  
fight who the hell are you   I mean you're
not    know  

00:54:44.790   00:54:44.800  
not   the absolute unknown because I know

not   the absolute unknown because I know
something    the

right     now     there's  

00:54:51.450   00:54:51.460  
right   right and and and then there's
  

00:54:51.460   00:54:54.330  
right   right and and and then there's
a     inhabit     there's

a known   and then there's
  

00:54:54.340   00:54:56.880  
a known   and then there's
the     given  

00:54:56.880   00:54:56.890  
the knower and the known is given
 

00:54:56.890   00:54:58.590  
the knower and the known is given
symbolic     I've 

00:54:58.590   00:54:58.600  
symbolic representation as far as I've
 

00:54:58.600   00:55:01.080  
symbolic representation as far as I've
   in  

00:55:01.080   00:55:01.090  
  been able to tell in patriarchal form in
  

00:55:01.090   00:55:03.930  
  been able to tell in patriarchal form in
the     deities     unknown  

00:55:03.930   00:55:03.940  
the form of male deities   and the unknown
  

00:55:03.940   00:55:06.000  
the form of male deities   and the unknown 
   feminine  

00:55:06.000   00:55:06.010  
   it's given feminine
  

00:55:06.010   00:55:08.730  
   it's given feminine
form     much  

00:55:08.730   00:55:08.740  
form so we won't get   into that too much

quite enamored of lobsters as some of
you     out    this  

00:55:50.490   00:55:50.500  
you might know because I found out   this
  

00:55:50.500   00:55:51.990  
you might know because I found out   this
just     I  

00:55:51.990   00:55:52.000  
just blew me away when   I found it out I
  

00:55:52.000   00:55:54.270  
just blew me away when   I found it out I 
   neuro  

00:55:54.270   00:55:54.280  
   done a lot of work in neuro
  

00:55:54.280   00:55:56.820  
   done a lot of work in neuro
chemistry     because  

00:55:56.820   00:55:56.830  
  chemistry some similar chemistry because
  

00:55:56.830   00:55:58.320  
  chemistry some similar chemistry because
I     drug  

00:55:58.320   00:55:58.330  
I used to   study alcoholism and drug
  

00:55:58.330   00:56:01.770  
I used to   study alcoholism and drug
abuse     alcoholism     alcohol  

00:56:01.770   00:56:01.780  
abuse   study alcohol
  

00:56:01.780   00:56:02.940  
abuse   study alcohol
you     the     brain  

00:56:02.940   00:56:02.950  
you have   brain
  

00:56:02.950   00:56:04.650  
you have   brain
because     the  

00:56:04.650   00:56:04.660  
because   alcohol goes everywhere in the
  

00:56:04.660   00:56:06.390  
because   alcohol goes everywhere in the
brain     chemical  

00:56:06.390   00:56:06.400  
brain   it affects every neural chemical
  

00:56:06.400   00:56:07.680  
brain   it affects every neural chemical
system     you're     study  

00:56:07.680   00:56:07.690  
system and so if you're   going to study
  

00:56:07.690   00:56:10.200  
system and so if you're   going to study
alcohol     neuro  

00:56:10.200   00:56:10.210  
alcohol it kind of has to   study neuro
  

00:56:10.210   00:56:12.270  
alcohol it kind of has to   study neuro
chemistry     general     that  

00:56:12.270   00:56:12.280  
chemistry in general   and so I did that
  

00:56:12.280   00:56:14.070  
chemistry in general   and so I did that 
   a

in all of   these creatures
  

00:57:49.010   00:57:52.390  
in all of   these creatures
engage     and  

00:57:52.390   00:57:52.400  
engage in in   dominance disputes and and
  

00:57:52.400   00:57:53.890  
engage in in   dominance disputes and and
I     to  

00:57:53.890   00:57:53.900  
I think dominance is the right way to

   aren't
  

00:57:55.400   00:57:56.680  
   aren't
very     not     very  

00:57:56.680   00:57:56.690  
very empathic and   very
  

00:57:56.690   00:57:58.510  
very empathic and   very
social     really     toughest  

00:57:58.510   00:57:58.520  
social and so it really   the toughest
  

00:57:58.520   00:58:00.910  
social and so it really   the toughest
lobster     so  

00:58:00.910   00:58:00.920  
lobster that wins   you know and what's so
  

00:58:00.920   00:58:03.580  
lobster that wins   you know and what's so
cool     a  

00:58:03.580   00:58:03.590  
cool   about the lobster is that when a
  

00:58:03.590   00:58:06.520  
cool   about the lobster is that when a
lobster     wins     bigger  

00:58:06.520   00:58:06.530  
lobster wins   he flexes and gets bigger
  

00:58:06.530   00:58:08.740  
lobster wins   he flexes and gets bigger 
   winner  

00:58:08.740   00:58:08.750  
   he's a winner
  

00:58:08.750   00:58:10.840  
   he's a winner
it's     advertising     the  

00:58:10.840   00:58:10.850  
it's like he's advertising   that and the
  

00:58:10.850   00:58:13.210  
it's like he's advertising   that and the 
   that  

00:58:13.210   00:58:13.220  
   system that
  

00:58:13.220   00:58:15.760  
   system that
makes     serotonergic     you  

00:58:15.760   00:58:15.770  
makes him flex is serotonergic   and you
  

00:58:15.770   00:58:17.110  
makes him flex is serotonergic   and you
think     cares     does  

00:58:17.110   00:58:17.120  
think well who cares   the hell does
  

00:58:17.120   00:58:18.640  
think well who cares   the hell does 
   means  

00:58:18.640   00:58:18.650  
   means
  

00:58:18.650   00:58:20.350  
   means
it's     affected  

00:58:20.350   00:58:20.360  
it's the same chemical   that's affected
  

00:58:20.360   00:58:22.570  
it's the same chemical   that's affected
by     and  

00:58:22.570   00:58:22.580  
by antidepressants   in human beings and
  

00:58:22.580   00:58:24.100  
by antidepressants   in human beings and
so     you're     a  

00:58:24.100   00:58:24.110  
so like if you're   depressed you're a
  

00:58:24.110   00:58:26.500  
so like if you're   depressed you're a
defeated     this  

00:58:26.500   00:58:26.510  
defeated   lobster like you're like this
  

00:58:26.510   00:58:28.660  
defeated   lobster like you're like this 
   are  

00:58:28.660   00:58:28.670  
  I'm small I'm not you know things are
  

00:58:28.670   00:58:30.700  
  I'm small I'm not you know things are
dangerous    give  

00:58:30.700   00:58:30.710  
dangerous   you give
  

00:58:30.710   00:58:32.200  
dangerous   you give
someone    up  

00:58:32.200   00:58:32.210  
someone   an antidepressant it's like up
  

00:58:32.210   00:58:34.150  
someone   an antidepressant it's like up
they     ready     to  

00:58:34.150   00:58:34.160  
they stretch   to
  

00:58:34.160   00:58:36.490  
they stretch   to
like     again     you  

00:58:36.490   00:58:36.500  
like take on the world again   well if you
  

00:58:36.500   00:58:38.440  
like take on the world again   well if you
give     in  

00:58:38.440   00:58:38.450  
give lobsters who just got   defeated in
  

00:58:38.450   00:58:40.720  
give lobsters who just got   defeated in 
   stretch  

00:58:40.720   00:58:40.730  
   serotonin then they stretch
  

00:58:40.730   00:58:42.550  
   serotonin then they stretch
out     and     that's  

00:58:42.550   00:58:42.560  
out and they'll fight again   that's
  

00:58:42.560   00:58:44.230  
out and they'll fight again   that's
like     creatures  

00:58:44.230   00:58:44.240  
like we separated from those creatures
 

00:58:44.240   00:58:46.600  
like we separated from those creatures
   somewhere  

00:58:46.600   00:58:46.610  
   somewhere
  

00:58:46.610   00:58:48.880  
   somewhere
between     ago  

00:58:48.880   00:58:48.890  
between 350   and 600 million years ago
  

00:58:48.890   00:58:50.980  
between 350   and 600 million years ago 
   same  

00:58:50.980   00:58:50.990  
   chemistry is the same
  

00:58:50.990   00:58:53.260  
   chemistry is the same
and     just  

00:58:53.260   00:58:53.270  
and so that's another   indication of just
  

00:58:53.270   00:58:56.800  
and so that's another   indication of just 
   authority  

00:58:56.800   00:58:56.810  
  how important hierarchies of authority
  

00:58:56.810   00:58:59.440  
  how important hierarchies of authority
are     conserved     since  

00:58:59.440   00:58:59.450  
are I mean   since
  

00:58:59.450   00:59:01.510  
are I mean   since
the     right     weren't  

00:59:01.510   00:59:01.520  
the time of lobsters right   there weren't
  

00:59:01.520   00:59:04.360  
the time of lobsters right   there weren't
trees     first  

00:59:04.360   00:59:04.370  
trees around when lobsters first first
 

00:59:04.370   00:59:06.370  
trees around when lobsters first first
manifested     planet    and  

00:59:06.370   00:59:06.380  
manifested themselves on the planet   and
  

00:59:06.380   00:59:08.500  
manifested themselves on the planet   and
so     what     hierarchies  

00:59:08.500   00:59:08.510  
   means is these hierarchies
  

00:59:08.510   00:59:10.030  
   means is these hierarchies
that    those  

00:59:10.030   00:59:10.040  
that   been talking about those
  

00:59:10.040   00:59:13.450  
that   been talking about those
things     one  

00:59:13.450   00:59:13.460  
things are older than trees and so one
 

00:59:13.460   00:59:16.690  
things are older than trees and so one
of   real  

00:59:16.690   00:59:16.700  
of   the truisms for what constitutes real
  

00:59:16.700   00:59:19.480  
of   the truisms for what constitutes real 
   that  

00:59:19.480   00:59:19.490  
  from a Darwinian perspective is that
  

00:59:19.490   00:59:22.300  
  from a Darwinian perspective is that 
   period  

00:59:22.300   00:59:22.310  
   period
  

00:59:22.310   00:59:23.740  
   period
of     time     the  

00:59:23.740   00:59:23.750  
of time   because it's had the
  

00:59:23.750   00:59:25.450  
of time   because it's had the
longest     exert  

00:59:25.450   00:59:25.460  
longest   period of time to exert
  

00:59:25.460   00:59:28.000  
longest   period of time to exert
selection     we  

00:59:28.000   00:59:28.010  
selection pressure   well we know we
  

00:59:28.010   00:59:30.370  
selection pressure   well we know we
evolved     something     on  

00:59:30.370   00:59:30.380  
evolved and lived in trees something   on
  

00:59:30.380   00:59:32.380  
evolved and lived in trees something   on
the    we're  

00:59:32.380   00:59:32.390  
the   ago we're
  

00:59:32.390   00:59:34.840  
the   ago we're 
   that  

00:59:34.840   00:59:34.850  
  talking ten times as far back as that
  

00:59:34.850   00:59:37.570  
  talking ten times as far back as that 
   that  

00:59:37.570   00:59:37.580  
  for the hierarchy and so the idea that
  

00:59:37.580   00:59:39.760  
  for the hierarchy and so the idea that 
   is  

00:59:39.760   00:59:39.770  
  human beings that the hierarchy is
  

00:59:39.770   00:59:41.530  
  human beings that the hierarchy is
something     exerted     selection  

00:59:41.530   00:59:41.540  
something that has exerted   selection
  

00:59:41.540   00:59:43.330  
something that has exerted   selection
pressure     beings     don't  

00:59:43.330   00:59:43.340  
pressure on human beings   don't
  

00:59:43.340   00:59:45.490  
pressure on human beings   don't
think     a

exactly     what     argue  

00:59:50.260   00:59:50.270  
exactly   means we can argue
  

00:59:50.270   00:59:52.020  
exactly   means we can argue 
   biological  

00:59:52.020   00:59:52.030  
   like that sort of biological
  

00:59:52.030   00:59:54.160

the other they'd stretch   themselves out
  

01:00:16.530   01:00:20.630  
the other they'd stretch   themselves out
like     hands     was  

01:00:20.630   01:00:20.640  
like snap their hands   that was
  

01:00:20.640   01:00:22.760  
like snap their hands   that was
that     funny     very  

01:00:22.760   01:00:22.770  
that   it was really very
  

01:00:22.770   01:00:25.010  
that   it was really very
funny     so  

01:00:25.010   01:00:25.020  
funny   so you see this in lobsters and so
  

01:00:25.020   01:00:26.090  
funny   so you see this in lobsters and so
that's     amazing  

01:00:26.090   01:00:26.100  
that's pretty amazing
 

01:00:26.100   01:00:28.910  
that's pretty amazing
so     know    thing  

01:00:28.910   01:00:28.920  
so you know   and one of the other thing
  

01:00:28.920   01:00:30.470  
so you know   and one of the other thing
that's    is  

01:00:30.470   01:00:30.480  
that's   cool about lobsters is
  

01:00:30.480   01:00:32.840  
that's   cool about lobsters is
that     you've     talk  

01:00:32.840   01:00:32.850  
that   been like talk
  

01:00:32.850   01:00:34.280  
that   been like talk 
   you're  

01:00:34.280   01:00:34.290  
  lobster for a long time but you're
  

01:00:34.290   01:00:35.950  
  lobster for a long time but you're
getting    young  

01:00:35.950   01:00:35.960  
getting   and some young
  

01:00:35.960   01:00:38.540  
getting   and some young
lobster     know     hell  

01:00:38.540   01:00:38.550  
lobster   whales the hell
  

01:00:38.550   01:00:40.220  
lobster   whales the hell
out     of     all  

01:00:40.220   01:00:40.230  
out of   and so you're all
  

01:00:40.230   01:00:42.080  
out of   and so you're all
depressed     thing     is  

01:00:42.080   01:00:42.090  
depressed but thing   is your brain is
  

01:00:42.090   01:00:44.420  
depressed but thing   is your brain is
dominant     much     a  

01:00:44.420   01:00:44.430  
dominant   a
  

01:00:44.430   01:00:45.860  
dominant   a
brain     so  

01:00:45.860   01:00:45.870  
brain because you're a lobster   and so
  

01:00:45.870   01:00:47.240  
brain because you're a lobster   and so
now     you  

01:00:47.240   01:00:47.250  
  now what are you going to do because you
  

01:00:47.250   01:00:49.610  
  now what are you going to do because you 
   your  

01:00:49.610   01:00:49.620  
   lost and the answer is while your
  

01:00:49.620   01:00:51.740  
   lost and the answer is while your
brain     grow  

01:00:51.740   01:00:51.750  
brain will dissolve and then you'll grow
 

01:00:51.750   01:00:55.040  
brain will dissolve and then you'll grow
a     brain    we're  

01:00:55.040   01:00:55.050  
a subordinate brain   yeah so that's we're
  

01:00:55.050   01:00:56.480  
a subordinate brain   yeah so that's we're
thinking     about     a  

01:00:56.480   01:00:56.490  
thinking about   for a
  

01:00:56.490   01:00:58.280  
thinking about   for a 
   of  

01:00:58.280   01:00:58.290  
  couple of reasons first of all if any of
  

01:00:58.290   01:01:00.770  
  couple of reasons first of all if any of
you     in  

01:01:00.770   01:01:00.780  
you have ever   been seriously defeated in
  

01:01:00.780   01:01:04.100  
you have ever   been seriously defeated in
life     like  

01:01:04.100   01:01:04.110  
life   you know what that's like it's like
  

01:01:04.110   01:01:06.980  
life   you know what that's like it's like
it's     dissolution     and  

01:01:06.980   01:01:06.990  
it's a death a descent a dissolution   and
  

01:01:06.990   01:01:09.830  
it's a death a descent a dissolution   and
if     regrowth     maybe  

01:01:09.830   01:01:09.840  
if you're lucky   and and maybe
  

01:01:09.840   01:01:11.450  
if you're lucky   and and maybe
not    what  

01:01:11.450   01:01:11.460  
not   person that's what
  

01:01:11.460   01:01:12.470  
not   person that's what
happens     post-traumatic  

01:01:12.470   01:01:12.480  
happens   to people with post-traumatic

right it dies   and shrinks and you can
sometimes     your

   help
that     shrinks  

01:01:50.540   01:01:50.550  
that but the damn amygdala never shrinks
 

01:01:50.550   01:01:53.660  
that but the damn amygdala never shrinks
again   another  

01:01:53.660   01:01:53.670  
again   and so well so that's another
  

01:01:53.670   01:01:55.430  
again   and so well so that's another
lesson     a  

01:01:55.430   01:01:55.440  
lesson from   the lobster it's quite a
  

01:01:55.440   01:01:57.860  
lesson from   the lobster it's quite a
terrifying     one     like  

01:01:57.860   01:01:57.870  
terrifying one   but but it's one like
  

01:01:57.870   01:01:59.600  
terrifying one   but but it's one like
it's     interesting     relate  

01:01:59.600   01:01:59.610  
it's so interesting   that you can relate
  

01:01:59.610   01:02:01.400  
it's so interesting   that you can relate
to     that  

01:02:01.400   01:02:01.410  
  to that right it's like I get what that
  

01:02:01.410   01:02:03.230  
  to that right it's like I get what that
poor     is     you  

01:02:03.230   01:02:03.240  
poor crustacean is   going through you
  

01:02:03.240   01:02:04.690  
poor crustacean is   going through you
know 

01:02:04.690   01:02:04.700  
know

know
so     is    from  

01:02:09.200   01:02:09.210  
so okay here's the rats and this is   from
  

01:02:09.210   01:02:11.270  
so okay here's the rats and this is   from 
   first

  research grant for giggling rats you
  

01:02:20.040   01:02:23.839  
  research grant for giggling rats you
know    play  

01:02:23.839   01:02:23.849  
know   aside but he discovered the play
  

01:02:23.849   01:02:26.510  
know   aside but he discovered the play
circuitry     in     deal  

01:02:26.510   01:02:26.520  
circuitry in   mammals that's a big deal
  

01:02:26.520   01:02:27.950  
circuitry in   mammals that's a big deal
right     discovering     new  

01:02:27.950   01:02:27.960  
   a whole new
  

01:02:27.960   01:02:30.500  
   a whole new
continent     play     enamels  

01:02:30.500   01:02:30.510  
continent there's a play   circuit enamels
  

01:02:30.510   01:02:32.660  
continent there's a play   circuit enamels 
   socially  

01:02:32.660   01:02:32.670  
  it's built right in so it's not socially
  

01:02:32.670   01:02:34.460  
  it's built right in so it's not socially
constructed     a  

01:02:34.460   01:02:34.470  
constructed   there's a there's a
  

01:02:34.470   01:02:37.150  
constructed   there's a there's a
biological     what  

01:02:37.150   01:02:37.160  
biological platform for that and so what
 

01:02:37.160   01:02:39.920  
biological platform for that and so what
   out  

01:02:39.920   01:02:39.930  
   he found out
  

01:02:39.930   01:02:42.650  
   he found out
if     puff     from  

01:02:42.650   01:02:42.660  
if rats   away from
  

01:02:42.660   01:02:44.780  
if rats   away from
its     it  

01:02:44.780   01:02:44.790  
its mother   it dies even if you feed it
  

01:02:44.790   01:02:46.789  
its mother   it dies even if you feed it
even     keep     you  

01:02:46.789   01:02:46.799  
even if you keep   it dies now you
  

01:02:46.799   01:02:48.650  
even if you keep   it dies now you
can     a  

01:02:48.650   01:02:48.660  
can stop it from   dying by taking a
  

01:02:48.660   01:02:50.530  
can stop it from   dying by taking a 
   and  

01:02:50.530   01:02:50.540  
   the end and
  

01:02:50.540   01:02:53.660  
   the end and
massaging     won't  

01:02:53.660   01:02:53.670  
massaging it right because   rats won't
  

01:02:53.670   01:02:55.789  
massaging it right because   rats won't
live     thing  

01:02:55.789   01:02:55.799  
live without   love and the same thing
  

01:02:55.799   01:02:57.470  
live without   love and the same thing
happens     that  

01:02:57.470   01:02:57.480  
happens to human babies and we saw that
 

01:02:57.480   01:02:59.510  
happens to human babies and we saw that
   catastrophe  

01:02:59.510   01:02:59.520  
  Romania when there was that catastrophe
  

01:02:59.520   01:03:01.520  
  Romania when there was that catastrophe 
   orphanages  

01:03:01.520   01:03:01.530  
  have to tell chesco in the orphanages
  

01:03:01.530   01:03:02.900  
  have to tell chesco in the orphanages 
   of  

01:03:02.900   01:03:02.910  
  where the orphanages were full of
  

01:03:02.910   01:03:04.609  
  where the orphanages were full of
unwanted     because     Ceausescu  

01:03:04.609   01:03:04.619  
unwanted babies because   Ceausescu
  

01:03:04.619   01:03:06.319  
unwanted babies because   Ceausescu
insisted     Romanian     was  

01:03:06.319   01:03:06.329  
insisted that every   woman was
  

01:03:06.329   01:03:08.240  
insisted that every   woman was
constantly     pregnant     is  

01:03:08.240   01:03:08.250  
constantly pregnant   so the orphan is
  

01:03:08.250   01:03:09.799  
constantly pregnant   so the orphan is
just     babies

   you do is you take
  

01:04:02.460   01:04:04.220  
   you do is you take
juvenile     that  

01:04:04.220   01:04:04.230  
juvenile rats and you   can find out that
  

01:04:04.230   01:04:07.940

  that so that you think while the rats
motivated     there  

01:04:31.940   01:04:31.950  
motivated   so the two rats go out there

hands well she didn't know that   either
  

01:05:43.740   01:05:45.560  
hands well she didn't know that   either
so     enough  

01:05:45.560   01:05:45.570  
so she hadn't been played   with enough
  

01:05:45.570   01:05:49.249  
so she hadn't been played   with enough
when     she     so  

01:05:49.249   01:05:49.259  
when she   rat and so
  

01:05:49.259   01:05:53.819  
when she   rat and so
anyways     the     the  

01:05:53.819   01:05:53.829  
anyways anyway so you let the   route the
  

01:05:53.829   01:05:55.319  
anyways anyway so you let the   route the
little     so  

01:05:55.319   01:05:55.329  
little rats go out there right and so
 

01:05:55.329   01:05:57.150  
little rats go out there right and so
let's     one    bigger  

01:05:57.150   01:05:57.160  
let's imagine one   10% bigger
  

01:05:57.160   01:05:59.880  
let's imagine one   10% bigger 
   bigger  

01:05:59.880   01:05:59.890  
   10% bigger
  

01:05:59.890   01:06:02.969  
   10% bigger 
   rat  

01:06:02.969   01:06:02.979  
  rat wins because 10% is enough in rat
  

01:06:02.979   01:06:04.620  
  rat wins because 10% is enough in rat
way     going     be  

01:06:04.620   01:06:04.630  
way to ensure that you're going   to be
  

01:06:04.630   01:06:07.319  
way to ensure that you're going   to be
the     penny     so  

01:06:07.319   01:06:07.329  
the   okay so
  

01:06:07.329   01:06:09.870  
the   okay so
so     so     the  

01:06:09.870   01:06:09.880  
so   net the rat the
  

01:06:09.880   01:06:12.059  
so   net the rat the
rat     rat  

01:06:12.059   01:06:12.069  
rat   pins the big rat pins a little rat
  

01:06:12.069   01:06:14.039  
rat   pins the big rat pins a little rat
and     is     the  

01:06:14.039   01:06:14.049  
and now the big rat is   the is the
  

01:06:14.049   01:06:17.789  
and now the big rat is   the is the
authority     the     time  

01:06:17.789   01:06:17.799  
authority rat and so then the   next time
  

01:06:17.799   01:06:20.009  
authority rat and so then the   next time
that    to  

01:06:20.009   01:06:20.019  
that   to
  

01:06:20.019   01:06:21.719  
that   to
invite     play     big  

01:06:21.719   01:06:21.729  
invite the big rat to play   so the big
  

01:06:21.729   01:06:23.489  
invite the big rat to play   so the big

they'll     and     a  

01:09:28.140   01:09:28.150  
they'll stand there and   they have a
  

01:09:28.150   01:09:30.660  
they'll stand there and   they have a
noise    crap  

01:09:30.660   01:09:30.670  
noise   it's like holy crap
  

01:09:30.670   01:09:33.780  
noise   it's like holy crap 
   actually  

01:09:33.780   01:09:33.790  
   it actually
  

01:09:33.790   01:09:35.430  
   it actually 
   why  

01:09:35.430   01:09:35.440  
   that technically I'll tell you why
  

01:09:35.440   01:09:38.329  
   that technically I'll tell you why
in     minute  

01:09:38.329   01:09:38.339  
 
 

01:09:38.339   01:09:40.500  
 
but     away    it  

01:09:40.500   01:09:40.510  
but they get they stand away   it
  

01:09:40.510   01:09:42.269  
but they get they stand away   it
then     this     which  

01:09:42.269   01:09:42.279  
then they make this   noise which
  

01:09:42.279   01:09:43.829  
then they make this   noise which
means     look     and  

01:09:43.829   01:09:43.839  
means oh my   at the snake and
  

01:09:43.839   01:09:45.510  
means oh my   at the snake and
then     24  

01:09:45.510   01:09:45.520  
  then they'll stand there for like 24
  

01:09:45.520   01:09:47.579  
  then they'll stand there for like 24 
   the  

01:09:47.579   01:09:47.589  
   the snake and so the
  

01:09:47.589   01:09:49.769  
   the snake and so the
snakes     super  

01:09:49.769   01:09:49.779  
snakes are really really they're super
 

01:09:49.779   01:09:51.870  
snakes are really really they're super
stimuli     for    pretty  

01:09:51.870   01:09:51.880  
stimuli for   chimpanzees so that's pretty
  

01:09:51.880   01:09:53.670  
stimuli for   chimpanzees so that's pretty 
   learn  

01:09:53.670   01:09:53.680  
   seem to learn
  

01:09:53.680   01:09:55.980  
   seem to learn
how     scare  

01:09:55.980   01:09:55.990  
how to take this dead snake and go scare
 

01:09:55.990   01:09:57.840

very rapidly spiders as well and so then
   were  

01:10:49.980   01:10:49.990  
   we were
  

01:10:49.990   01:10:52.280  
   we were
prepared    or  

01:10:52.280   01:10:52.290  
prepared   fear to snakes or
  

01:10:52.290   01:10:55.830

recent   it's  

01:10:57.600   01:10:57.610  
recent   has indicated that it's
  

01:10:57.610   01:11:00.030  
recent   has indicated that it's
more     have  

01:11:00.030   01:11:00.040  
more than just prepared   is that we have
  

01:11:00.040   01:11:02.160  
more than just prepared   is that we have

the detection circuitry   built right into
  

01:11:02.170   01:11:05.280  
the detection circuitry   built right into
us     wouldn't  

01:11:05.280   01:11:05.290  
us and well is   because well why wouldn't
  

01:11:05.290   01:11:07.650  
us and well is   because well why wouldn't 
   it's  

01:11:07.650   01:11:07.660  
   issue it's
  

01:11:07.660   01:11:08.940  
   issue it's
like     it's     a  

01:11:08.940   01:11:08.950  
like   much of a
  

01:11:08.950   01:11:10.470  
like   much of a
surprise    human  

01:11:10.470   01:11:10.480  
surprise   think of human
  

01:11:10.480   01:11:12.540  
surprise   think of human 
   think  

01:11:12.540   01:11:12.550  
  beings as a blank slate and if you think
  

01:11:12.550   01:11:15.570  
  beings as a blank slate and if you think
that    crawl  

01:11:15.570   01:11:15.580  
that   been I don't know you should crawl
  

01:11:15.580   01:11:17.520  
that   been I don't know you should crawl
out     of     that's  

01:11:17.520   01:11:17.530  
out of   the 16th century that's that's
  

01:11:17.530   01:11:19.110  
out of   the 16th century that's that's
all     would     it  

01:11:19.110   01:11:19.120  
all I would   would look at it
  

01:11:19.120   01:11:20.730  
all I would   would look at it 
   just  

01:11:20.730   01:11:20.740  
  because I mean that's that's that's just
  

01:11:20.740   01:11:24.500  
  because I mean that's that's that's just
go     wrong  

01:11:24.500   01:11:24.510  
  go on that idea it's it's it's so wrong
  

01:11:24.510   01:11:29.370  
  go on that idea it's it's it's so wrong
so     think     as  

01:11:29.370   01:11:29.380  
   about this as
  

01:11:29.380   01:11:31.050  
   about this as
a     look  

01:11:31.050   01:11:31.060  
a dominance   hierarchy but wolves look
  

01:11:31.060   01:11:34.680  
a dominance   hierarchy but wolves look
for     wolves     credibility  

01:11:34.680   01:11:34.690  
for   look for credibility
  

01:11:34.690   01:11:37.080  
for   look for credibility 
   and  

01:11:37.080   01:11:37.090  
  and competence as well and and
  

01:11:37.090   01:11:39.510  
  and competence as well and and
chimpanzees     tyrants  

01:11:39.510   01:11:39.520  
chimpanzees   don't like brutal tyrants
  

01:11:39.520   01:11:41.040  
chimpanzees   don't like brutal tyrants
and     talk     the  

01:11:41.040   01:11:41.050  
and so we'll   it as the
  

01:11:41.050   01:11:43.680  
and so we'll   it as the
hierarchy    this  

01:11:43.680   01:11:43.690  
hierarchy   and so well this
  

01:11:43.690   01:11:45.570  
hierarchy   and so well this 
   you  

01:11:45.570   01:11:45.580  
   develop you
  

01:11:45.580   01:11:47.550  
   develop you 
   are  

01:11:47.550   01:11:47.560  
   girls are
  

01:11:47.560   01:11:48.990  
   girls are
negotiating     environment  

01:11:48.990   01:11:49.000  
negotiating   the domestic environment
  

01:11:49.000   01:11:51.300  
negotiating   the domestic environment 
   how  

01:11:51.300   01:11:51.310  
   and how to behave properly and how
  

01:11:51.310   01:11:53.070  
   and how to behave properly and how
to     take  

01:11:53.070   01:11:53.080  
to share and   all that and turn and take
  

01:11:53.080   01:11:55.320  
to share and   all that and turn and take
turns     the  

01:11:55.320   01:11:55.330  
turns   and so they're negotiating the
  

01:11:55.330   01:11:57.180  
turns   and so they're negotiating the
hierarchy    you're  

01:11:57.180   01:11:57.190  
hierarchy   and if you're
  

01:11:57.190   01:11:58.890  
hierarchy   and if you're
good     sometimes  

01:11:58.890   01:11:58.900  
good at reciprocity   it's sometimes
  

01:11:58.900   01:12:00.420  
good at reciprocity   it's sometimes
you're     the     the  

01:12:00.420   01:12:00.430  
you're the   authority and sometimes the
  

01:12:00.430   01:12:01.920  
you're the   authority and sometimes the 
   that's  

01:12:01.920   01:12:01.930  
   the authority that's
  

01:12:01.930   01:12:04.260  
   the authority that's
fair     are  

01:12:04.260   01:12:04.270  
fair play   right and so these boys are
  

01:12:04.270   01:12:05.670  
fair play   right and so these boys are
doing     they're  

01:12:05.670   01:12:05.680  
doing   the same thing and you see they're
  

01:12:05.680   01:12:07.800  
doing   the same thing and you see they're
all     like  

01:12:07.800   01:12:07.810  
all   smiling away and so it looks like
  

01:12:07.810   01:12:10.050  
all   smiling away and so it looks like
aggressive     people     are  

01:12:10.050   01:12:10.060  
aggressive behavior   who are
  

01:12:10.060   01:12:11.669  
aggressive behavior   who are
not 

01:12:11.669   01:12:11.679  
not
 

01:12:11.679   01:12:14.489  
not
very     attentive    and  

01:12:14.489   01:12:14.499  
very attentive   and who are paranoid and
  

01:12:14.499   01:12:19.859  
very attentive   and who are paranoid and
who     confuse  

01:12:19.859   01:12:19.869  
who   don't like human beings can confuse
  

01:12:19.869   01:12:21.989  
who   don't like human beings can confuse
this    it  

01:12:21.989   01:12:21.999  
this   it
  

01:12:21.999   01:12:24.270  
this   it
at     know     when  

01:12:24.270   01:12:24.280  
at schools which is you know   I know when

my    example  

01:12:26.009   01:12:26.019  
my   example
  

01:12:26.019   01:12:28.169  
my   example 
   were  

01:12:28.169   01:12:28.179

I   but he was 
   with  

01:12:49.469   01:12:49.479  
  happy with he was certainly happy with
  

01:12:49.479   01:12:51.149  
  happy with he was certainly happy with
the     idea     about  

01:12:51.149   01:12:51.159  
the idea   which made me very happy about

the idea   which made me very happy about
him    to

01:13:04.059   01:13:05.850  
them and   they that needs to happen 
   because

   two and four because

   two and four because
if     time

if they're not   civilized by the time
  

01:13:07.239   01:13:08.640  
if they're not   civilized by the time
they're     4     just  

01:13:08.640   01:13:08.650  
they're   then you might as well just
  

01:13:08.650   01:13:09.120  
they're   then you might as well just
forget     it

forget   it
and     statistic  

01:13:11.429   01:13:11.439  
and that's a   that's a horrible statistic
  

01:13:11.439   01:13:13.560  
and that's a   that's a horrible statistic 
   in

01:13:14.850   01:13:14.860  
  the relevant developmental literature
  

01:13:14.860   01:13:16.350  
  the relevant developmental literature
like     aggressive  

01:13:16.350   01:13:16.360  
like there's   lots of aggressive
  

01:13:16.360   01:13:17.870  
like there's   lots of aggressive
two-year-olds     and  

01:13:17.870   01:13:17.880  
two-year-olds most of them are male and
 

01:13:17.880   01:13:20.310  
two-year-olds most of them are male and
if     of 

01:13:20.310   01:13:20.320  
if they stay aggressive past the age of
 

01:13:20.320   01:13:22.169  
if they stay aggressive past the age of
   aggressive  

01:13:22.169   01:13:22.179  
  four they tend to be lifetime aggressive
  

01:13:22.179   01:13:24.330  
  four they tend to be lifetime aggressive
they     outcasts  

01:13:24.330   01:13:24.340  
they make no friends   they're outcasts
  

01:13:24.340   01:13:25.439  
they make no friends   they're outcasts
they're     more     up  

01:13:25.439   01:13:25.449  
they're much more   to end up
  

01:13:25.449   01:13:27.899  
they're much more   to end up 
   in  

01:13:27.899   01:13:27.909  
  antisocial criminal delinquent and in
  

01:13:27.909   01:13:30.750  
  antisocial criminal delinquent and in
jail     and     be  

01:13:30.750   01:13:30.760  
jail and   so your kids need to be
  

01:13:30.760   01:13:32.219  
jail and   so your kids need to be
socialized     two     and  

01:13:32.219   01:13:32.229  
socialized between the ages of   and
  

01:13:32.229   01:13:34.620  
socialized between the ages of   and 
   for  

01:13:34.620   01:13:34.630  
  four and that's particularly true for
  

01:13:34.630   01:13:36.270  
  four and that's particularly true for
the     males     of  

01:13:36.270   01:13:36.280  
the more   and most of
  

01:13:36.280   01:13:37.709  
the more   and most of
the     and  

01:13:37.709   01:13:37.719  
the rest   of two-year-olds are male and
  

01:13:37.719   01:13:41.069  
the rest   of two-year-olds are male and 
   so  

01:13:41.069   01:13:41.079  
   by the way so
  

01:13:41.079   01:13:42.929  
   by the way so
there's     a     abstract  

01:13:42.929   01:13:42.939  
there's a   more--not more abstract
  

01:13:42.939   01:13:44.489  
there's a   more--not more abstract
representation     of     thing  

01:13:44.489   01:13:44.499  
representation of   same sort of thing
  

01:13:44.499   01:13:46.109  
representation of   same sort of thing
and    that  

01:13:46.109   01:13:46.119  
and   that
  

01:13:46.119   01:13:48.179  
and   that
this     the     of  

01:13:48.179   01:13:48.189  
this that the that the   of
  

01:13:48.189   01:13:50.209  
this that the that the   of
authority    game-like

and that's   one of the things that one of
  

01:13:54.459   01:13:55.799  
and that's   one of the things that one of
the     that's     about

the things that's   so brilliant about
  

01:13:55.809   01:13:58.140  
the things that's   so brilliant about
Jean     Piaget     so  

01:13:58.140   01:13:58.150  
Jean Piaget   it's so
  

01:13:58.150   01:14:00.330  
Jean Piaget   it's so
smart     the  

01:14:00.330   01:14:00.340  
smart   and he was interested in the
  

01:14:00.340   01:14:02.790  
smart   and he was interested in the 
   he  

01:14:02.790   01:14:02.800  
   and he
  

01:14:02.800   01:14:07.049  
   and he 
   origin  

01:14:07.049   01:14:07.059  
   he he he traced the origin
  

01:14:07.059   01:14:09.299  
   he he he traced the origin
to     morality  

01:14:09.299   01:14:09.309  
to play and the emergence of   morality
  

01:14:09.309   01:14:11.370  
to play and the emergence of   morality
out     smart  

01:14:11.370   01:14:11.380  
out of play and that's it's so smart
 

01:14:11.380   01:14:13.379  
out of play and that's it's so smart
   smart  

01:14:13.379   01:14:13.389  
   can't believe how smart
  

01:14:13.389   01:14:14.939  
   can't believe how smart
an     the  

01:14:14.939   01:14:14.949  
an idea that was   because it's the
  

01:14:14.949   01:14:19.259  
an idea that was   because it's the 
   morality  

01:14:19.259   01:14:19.269  
   construction of of morality
  

01:14:19.269   01:14:21.449  
   construction of of morality
now     was     to  

01:14:21.449   01:14:21.459  
now Piaget was   a constructionist and to
  

01:14:21.459   01:14:23.549  
now Piaget was   a constructionist and to
some     constructionist     he  

01:14:23.549   01:14:23.559  
some degree   he
  

01:14:23.559   01:14:25.170  
some degree   he
underestimated     of  

01:14:25.170   01:14:25.180  
underestimated the role of
 

01:14:25.180   01:14:27.450  
underestimated the role of
biology     invalidate    his  

01:14:27.450   01:14:27.460  
biology but that doesn't invalidate   his
  

01:14:27.460   01:14:28.800  
biology but that doesn't invalidate   his
theory     easy     a  

01:14:28.800   01:14:28.810  
theory it's really easy   to put a
  

01:14:28.810   01:14:30.260  
theory it's really easy   to put a
biological     underneath  

01:14:30.260   01:14:30.270  
biological underpinning underneath
 

01:14:30.270   01:14:32.580  
biological underpinning underneath
underneath   the  

01:14:32.580   01:14:32.590  
underneath   the

underneath   the
biology    quite  

01:14:34.230   01:14:34.240  
biology   well enough to do it quite quite
  

01:14:34.240   01:14:38.910  
biology   well enough to do it quite quite
nicely     now     fact  

01:14:38.910   01:14:38.920  
nicely now   so I mean we well the fact
  

01:14:38.920   01:14:40.200  
nicely now   so I mean we well the fact
that     example     could  

01:14:40.200   01:14:40.210  
that tanks have for example   could
  

01:14:40.210   01:14:41.940  
that tanks have for example   could
identify     really  

01:14:41.940   01:14:41.950  
identify the play circuit is a really
 

01:14:41.950   01:14:44.100  
identify the play circuit is a really
good     that    play  

01:14:44.100   01:14:44.110  
good start with that   right because play
  

01:14:44.110   01:14:46.170  
good start with that   right because play
has     so     a  

01:14:46.170   01:14:46.180  
has been around so   long that we have a
  

01:14:46.180   01:14:48.990  
has been around so   long that we have a
circuit    so  

01:14:48.990   01:14:49.000  
circuit   it and so
  

01:14:49.000   01:14:50.970  
circuit   it and so
that's     that's     that's  

01:14:50.970   01:14:50.980  
that's that's   that's
  

01:14:50.980   01:14:52.860  
that's that's   that's
a     ancient     know  

01:14:52.860   01:14:52.870  
a very ancient   issue and so you know
  

01:14:52.870   01:14:54.510  
a very ancient   issue and so you know
this     is     an  

01:14:54.510   01:14:54.520  
this is this is   very much of an
  

01:14:54.520   01:14:56.640  
this is this is   very much of an
abstraction     game     of  

01:14:56.640   01:14:56.650  
abstraction of a game   here and then of
  

01:14:56.650   01:14:58.350  
abstraction of a game   here and then of
course    abstraction  

01:14:58.350   01:14:58.360  
course   get the ultimate abstraction
  

01:14:58.360   01:15:00.540  
course   get the ultimate abstraction
in     representation     a  

01:15:00.540   01:15:00.550  
in representation   what in a
  

01:15:00.550   01:15:05.430  
in representation   what in a
representation    even  

01:15:05.430   01:15:05.440  
representation   like like that where even
  

01:15:05.440   01:15:07.530  
representation   like like that where even 
   is  

01:15:07.530   01:15:07.540  
   of the game is
  

01:15:07.540   01:15:09.420  
   of the game is 
   migrated  

01:15:09.420   01:15:09.430  
  fictional and of course we've migrated
  

01:15:09.430   01:15:11.220  
  fictional and of course we've migrated
to     degree     of  

01:15:11.220   01:15:11.230  
to a large degree   into those sorts of
  

01:15:11.230   01:15:13.670  
to a large degree   into those sorts of
fictional     books

01:15:13.680   01:15:18.570  
fictional landscapes fictional books
   it's  

01:15:18.570   01:15:18.580  
  movies video games so it's the same it's
  

01:15:18.580   01:15:20.730  
  movies video games so it's the same it's
an    so  

01:15:20.730   01:15:20.740  
an   the same thing so
  

01:15:20.740   01:15:23.580  
an   the same thing so
practice     for     the  

01:15:23.580   01:15:23.590  
practice for practice for   real life the
  

01:15:23.590   01:15:25.020

shades in some cases into real life
 

01:15:25.030   01:15:33.210  
shades in some cases into real life
itself     so    representations  

01:15:33.210   01:15:33.220  
itself so   alright more representations
  

01:15:33.220   01:15:34.350  
itself so   alright more representations
of     like     these  

01:15:34.350   01:15:34.360  
of God the Father I like   these

01:15:37.660   01:15:39.900  
representations   idea
I     I     a  

01:15:39.900   01:15:39.910  
   wearing a
  

01:15:39.910   01:15:41.700  
   wearing a
triangular     kind     strange  

01:15:41.700   01:15:41.710  
triangular hat   of a strange
  

01:15:41.710   01:15:43.170  
triangular hat   of a strange 
   it's  

01:15:43.170   01:15:43.180  
   it's
  

01:15:43.180   01:15:44.850  
   it's 
   pyramid  

01:15:44.850   01:15:44.860  
   idea of the pyramid
  

01:15:44.860   01:15:46.590  
   idea of the pyramid
and     the  

01:15:46.590   01:15:46.600  
  and I think that's associated with the
  

01:15:46.600   01:15:48.480  
  and I think that's associated with the
idea     the     I  

01:15:48.480   01:15:48.490  
   and I
  

01:15:48.490   01:15:50.220  
   and I
think     their  

01:15:50.220   01:15:50.230  
think that's why the   Egyptians put their
  

01:15:50.230   01:15:52.320  
think that's why the   Egyptians put their
pharaohs     there's  

01:15:52.320   01:15:52.330  
pharaohs inside pyramids   I know there's
  

01:15:52.330   01:15:54.030  
pharaohs inside pyramids   I know there's
more    of  

01:15:54.030   01:15:54.040  
more   but I think some of
  

01:15:54.040   01:15:56.160  
more   but I think some of
that     has     this  

01:15:56.160   01:15:56.170  
that   this
  

01:15:56.170   01:15:58.440  
that   this
hierarchical    on  

01:15:58.440   01:15:58.450  
hierarchical   this on
  

01:15:58.450   01:16:00.600  
hierarchical   this on
that     speculative     obviously  

01:16:00.600   01:16:00.610  
that now that's speculative   obviously
  

01:16:00.610   01:16:01.920  
that now that's speculative   obviously
and     much     it  

01:16:01.920   01:16:01.930  
and I don't   it
  

01:16:01.930   01:16:04.110  
and I don't   it
but     that  

01:16:04.110   01:16:04.120  
but but I can't help but   think that
  

01:16:04.120   01:16:05.730  
but but I can't help but   think that 
   on  

01:16:05.730   01:16:05.740  
   see that's on
  

01:16:05.740   01:16:07.260  
   see that's on
the     of     I  

01:16:07.260   01:16:07.270  
the back of   I
  

01:16:07.270   01:16:09.240  
the back of   I
like     that's     of  

01:16:09.240   01:16:09.250  
like that a lot   like the Eye of
  

01:16:09.250   01:16:11.430  
like that a lot   like the Eye of 
   idea  

01:16:11.430   01:16:11.440  
  Horus from the Egyptians and so the idea
  

01:16:11.440   01:16:14.010  
  Horus from the Egyptians and so the idea
here    the  

01:16:14.010   01:16:14.020  
here   is something like at the top of the
  

01:16:14.020   01:16:15.450  
here   is something like at the top of the
hierarchy     longer  

01:16:15.450   01:16:15.460  
hierarchy   is something that is no longer
  

01:16:15.460   01:16:18.360  
hierarchy   is something that is no longer 
   you  

01:16:18.360   01:16:18.370  
   right so if you
  

01:16:18.370   01:16:20.100  
   right so if you
move     up     what  

01:16:20.100   01:16:20.110  
move up   the hierarchy enough what
  

01:16:20.110   01:16:22.110  
move up   the hierarchy enough what
happens     develop     ability  

01:16:22.110   01:16:22.120  
happens is   ability
  

01:16:22.120   01:16:23.610  
happens is   ability
as     consequence     that  

01:16:23.610   01:16:23.620  
as a consequence   of moving up that
  

01:16:23.620   01:16:25.710  
as a consequence   of moving up that
hierarchy     the  

01:16:25.710   01:16:25.720  
hierarchy   to be detached enough from the
  

01:16:25.720   01:16:27.090  
hierarchy   to be detached enough from the
hierarchy     no     really  

01:16:27.090   01:16:27.100  
hierarchy   longer really
  

01:16:27.100   01:16:29.310  
hierarchy   longer really
part    in  

01:16:29.310   01:16:29.320  
part   you can move in
  

01:16:29.320   01:16:30.750  
part   you can move in
all     and  

01:16:30.750   01:16:30.760  
all sorts of different hierarchies and
 

01:16:30.760   01:16:32.520  
all sorts of different hierarchies and
the     the    the  

01:16:32.520   01:16:32.530  
the thing the   idea here is that the
  

01:16:32.530   01:16:33.840  
the thing the   idea here is that the
thing     that     is  

01:16:33.840   01:16:33.850  
thing   you're really developing is
  

01:16:33.850   01:16:36.150  
thing   you're really developing is
the     attention     I  

01:16:36.150   01:16:36.160  
the capacity to pay attention   and I
  

01:16:36.160   01:16:39.360  
the capacity to pay attention   and I
would     from

all the   head and he could
speak     that  

01:17:07.020   01:17:07.030  
speak magic words   and I really like that

speak magic words   and I really like that 
   the  

01:17:09.150   01:17:09.160  
  I really like that idea and the
  

01:17:09.160   01:17:10.530  
  I really like that idea and the
Egyptians     developed     too  

01:17:10.530   01:17:10.540  
Egyptians developed   that idea too
  

01:17:10.540   01:17:12.150  
Egyptians developed   that idea too
because     eye  

01:17:12.150   01:17:12.160  
because their god Horus was the   eye
  

01:17:12.160   01:17:14.040  
because their god Horus was the   eye 
   that  

01:17:14.040   01:17:14.050

   that
that     compelling  

01:17:16.470   01:17:16.480  
that sense that image is so compelling
 

01:17:16.480   01:17:18.840  
that sense that image is so compelling

seen   a really open
pupil     Egyptians     was  

01:17:23.730   01:17:23.740  
pupil   was
  

01:17:23.740   01:17:26.490  
pupil   was
that     revivified  

01:17:26.490   01:17:26.500  
that the open eye was what revivified
 

01:17:26.500   01:17:29.640  
that the open eye was what revivified
the     Society    what

bloody well pay attention and   that isn't
  

01:17:33.580   01:17:35.100  
bloody well pay attention and   that isn't
the     same     different  

01:17:35.100   01:17:35.110  
   as thinking it's a different
  

01:17:35.110   01:17:37.680  
   as thinking it's a different
process    is  

01:17:37.680   01:17:37.690  
process   paying attention thinking is
  

01:17:37.690   01:17:39.540  
process   paying attention thinking is
like     some  

01:17:39.540   01:17:39.550  
like the imposition of structure in some
 

01:17:39.550   01:17:42.030  
like the imposition of structure in some
sense   but  

01:17:42.030   01:17:42.040  
sense   but
  

01:17:42.040   01:17:43.470  
sense   but
paying     like  

01:17:43.470   01:17:43.480  
paying attention is   something like
  

01:17:43.480   01:17:46.080  
paying attention is   something like
watching     for     so  

01:17:46.080   01:17:46.090  
watching for   know and so
  

01:17:46.090   01:17:47.490  
watching for   know and so
like     I     recommend  

01:17:47.490   01:17:47.500  
like one of the things I   often recommend
  

01:17:47.500   01:17:49.110  
like one of the things I   often recommend 
   having

01:18:40.260   01:18:43.110  
them so that you'll have   your prejudices
reinforced     people  

01:18:43.110   01:18:43.120  
reinforced   that's usually how people
  

01:18:43.120   01:18:45.090  
reinforced   that's usually how people
interact     thinking  

01:18:45.090   01:18:45.100  
interact is like I want   to keep thinking
  

01:18:45.100   01:18:46.770

   you  

01:18:46.770   01:18:46.780  
  about you the way I'm thinking about you
  

01:18:46.780   01:18:48.390  
  about you the way I'm thinking about you 
   anything  

01:18:48.390   01:18:48.400  
  and so I'm going to filter out anything
  

01:18:48.400   01:18:51.090  
  and so I'm going to filter out anything 
   not  

01:18:51.090   01:18:51.100  
   that's not
  

01:18:51.100   01:18:52.979  
   that's not
what     talking     like  

01:18:52.979   01:18:52.989  
what I'm talking   about at all it's like
  

01:18:52.989   01:18:54.359  
what I'm talking   about at all it's like
I'm     watch     out  

01:18:54.359   01:18:54.369  
I'm going to watch   out
  

01:18:54.369   01:18:56.430  
I'm going to watch   out
what     none  

01:18:56.430   01:18:56.440  
what you're up   to not in a rude way none
  

01:18:56.440   01:18:59.040  
what you're up   to not in a rude way none
of     I     there  

01:18:59.040   01:18:59.050  
of   just want to see what's there
  

01:18:59.050   01:19:01.589  
of   just want to see what's there 
   and  

01:19:01.589   01:19:01.599  
   good for you probably and
  

01:19:01.599   01:19:05.069  
   good for you probably and
also     good     so  

01:19:05.069   01:19:05.079  
also be good   so well so
  

01:19:05.079   01:19:07.049  
also be good   so well so
that's     idea     climbing  

01:19:07.049   01:19:07.059  
that's the idea   you know climbing
  

01:19:07.059   01:19:08.819  
that's the idea   you know climbing
up     hierarchy     you  

01:19:08.819   01:19:08.829  
up a hierarchy   authority can give you
  

01:19:08.829   01:19:11.850  
up a hierarchy   authority can give you
vision     the  

01:19:11.850   01:19:11.860  
vision and that vision can transcend the
 

01:19:11.860   01:19:13.950  
vision and that vision can transcend the
actual     hierarchy    also  

01:19:13.950   01:19:13.960  
actual hierarchy   and I think that's also
  

01:19:13.960   01:19:17.729  
actual hierarchy   and I think that's also 
   the  

01:19:17.729   01:19:17.739  
   the that's the
  

01:19:17.739   01:19:19.140  
   the that's the 
   artist  

01:19:19.140   01:19:19.150  
  metaphysical space that an artist
  

01:19:19.150   01:19:21.330  
  metaphysical space that an artist
occupies     aren't  

01:19:21.330   01:19:21.340  
occupies   because artists really aren't
  

01:19:21.340   01:19:22.770  
occupies   because artists really aren't
in     of  

01:19:22.770   01:19:22.780  
in a hierarchy there outside   of
  

01:19:22.780   01:19:24.720  
in a hierarchy there outside   of
hierarchies     King  

01:19:24.720   01:19:24.730  
hierarchies   you've watched the Lion King
  

01:19:24.730   01:19:28.529  
hierarchies   you've watched the Lion King
most     that     you  

01:19:28.529   01:19:28.539  
most of you   zoo you
  

01:19:28.539   01:19:29.850  
most of you   zoo you
know     bird     of  

01:19:29.850   01:19:29.860  
know the little bird   that's the eye of
  

01:19:29.860   01:19:32.009  
know the little bird   that's the eye of
the     so  

01:19:32.009   01:19:32.019  
the   king that's the same thing there so
  

01:19:32.019   01:19:34.200  
the   king that's the same thing there so
and     as  

01:19:34.200   01:19:34.210  
and that's that's echoed in this idea as
 

01:19:34.210   01:19:39.569  
and that's that's echoed in this idea as
well   more  

01:19:39.569   01:19:39.579  
well   so so well that's some more more
  

01:19:39.579   01:19:41.489  
well   so so well that's some more more
ideas     is  

01:19:41.489   01:19:41.499  
ideas   of hierarchies same idea this is
  

01:19:41.499   01:19:46.649  
ideas   of hierarchies same idea this is 
   gold  

01:19:46.649   01:19:46.659  
   why gold gold
  

01:19:46.659   01:19:49.919  
   why gold gold
is     the     the  

01:19:49.919   01:19:49.929  
is the   Gold is pure right so the
  

01:19:49.929   01:19:52.229  
is the   Gold is pure right so the 
   top  

01:19:52.229   01:19:52.239  
  idea is that the thing that's at the top
  

01:19:52.239   01:19:53.759  
  idea is that the thing that's at the top 
   incorruptible  

01:19:53.759   01:19:53.769  
   is incorruptible
  

01:19:53.769   01:19:55.229  
   is incorruptible
because     anything  

01:19:55.229   01:19:55.239  
because gold   doesn't mix with anything
  

01:19:55.239   01:19:56.729  
because gold   doesn't mix with anything 
   that  

01:19:56.729   01:19:56.739  
  else right it's this sort of metal that
  

01:19:56.739   01:19:58.799  
  else right it's this sort of metal that
doesn't     a  

01:19:58.799   01:19:58.809  
doesn't   ever become corrupted it's a
  

01:19:58.809   01:20:00.479  
doesn't   ever become corrupted it's a
noble    corrupted  

01:20:00.479   01:20:00.489  
noble   it doesn't become corrupted
  

01:20:00.489   01:20:02.819  
noble   it doesn't become corrupted 
   it's  

01:20:02.819   01:20:02.829  
   and it's
  

01:20:02.829   01:20:04.470  
   and it's
associated     with     top  

01:20:04.470   01:20:04.480  
associated with   what's ever at the top
  

01:20:04.480   01:20:06.899  
associated with   what's ever at the top
of     gold     gold  

01:20:06.899   01:20:06.909  
of the   the gold
  

01:20:06.909   01:20:08.850  
of the   the gold 
   it's  

01:20:08.850   01:20:08.860  
   like the Sun and it's

and     out  

01:20:56.609   01:20:56.619  
and then the next contestant comes out
 

01:20:56.619   01:20:58.020  
and then the next contestant comes out
and     it's    just  

01:20:58.020   01:20:58.030  
and it's   just
  

01:20:58.030   01:20:59.609  
and it's   just
basically     this  

01:20:59.609   01:20:59.619  
basically screwed   right it's like this
  

01:20:59.619   01:21:01.229  
basically screwed   right it's like this
person     perfect  

01:21:01.229   01:21:01.239  
person   came out there and was perfect
  

01:21:01.239   01:21:03.209  
person   came out there and was perfect
how     an  

01:21:03.209   01:21:03.219  
how are you going   to top that that's an
  

01:21:03.219   01:21:06.300  
how are you going   to top that that's an
interesting     this  

01:21:06.300   01:21:06.310  
  interesting question because this
  

01:21:06.310   01:21:08.880  
  interesting question because this
is     what     to  

01:21:08.880   01:21:08.890  
is a representation of what   to
  

01:21:08.890   01:21:11.880  
is a representation of what   to
top     it  

01:21:11.880   01:21:11.890  
top perfection itself   and you can do it
  

01:21:11.890   01:21:13.530  
top perfection itself   and you can do it 
   know  

01:21:13.530   01:21:13.540  
   you know
  

01:21:13.540   01:21:15.300  
   you know 
   know  

01:21:15.300   01:21:15.310  
  this even though you don't know you know
  

01:21:15.310   01:21:17.460  
  this even though you don't know you know
it     contestant  

01:21:17.460   01:21:17.470  
it so   let's say the next contestant
  

01:21:17.470   01:21:18.750  
it so   let's say the next contestant
comes     because  

01:21:18.750   01:21:18.760  
comes out   they're kind of shaky because
  

01:21:18.760   01:21:20.790  
comes out   they're kind of shaky because 
   raised  

01:21:20.790   01:21:20.800  
   raised
  

01:21:20.800   01:21:23.790  
   raised
high     what     put  

01:21:23.790   01:21:23.800  
high so what   they do is they put
  

01:21:23.800   01:21:25.620  
high so what   they do is they put
themselves    chaos  

01:21:25.620   01:21:25.630  
themselves   chaos
  

01:21:25.630   01:21:28.500  
themselves   chaos
and     by     that  

01:21:28.500   01:21:28.510  
and you can tell by   watching them that
  

01:21:28.510   01:21:31.500  
and you can tell by   watching them that

  and you say that you don't really know
what     stupid

what you mean you feel kind of stupid
 

01:23:00.010   01:23:01.380  
what you mean you feel kind of stupid
saying     it    true

   there's
something     he  

01:23:03.990   01:23:04.000  
something   wrong with you because he

01:23:04.900   01:23:07.950  
  doesn't know what you're talking about 
   so  

01:23:07.950   01:23:07.960  
  either but you know it's true and so
  

01:23:07.960   01:23:12.630  
  either but you know it's true and so
here's     life     game  

01:23:12.630   01:23:12.640  
here's why it's true life   isn't a game
  

01:23:12.640   01:23:16.290  
here's why it's true life   isn't a game
it's     rule     is  

01:23:16.290   01:23:16.300  
it's a set of games   is
  

01:23:16.300   01:23:18.960  
it's a set of games   is
never     victory     set  

01:23:18.960   01:23:18.970  
never sacrifice victory   across the set
  

01:23:18.970   01:23:20.100  
never sacrifice victory   across the set
of     and  

01:23:20.100   01:23:20.110  
of games for victory and
 

01:23:20.110   01:23:22.830  
of games for victory and
one     game    means  

01:23:22.830   01:23:22.840  
one game   means
  

01:23:22.840   01:23:25.410  
one game   means
to     so  

01:23:25.410   01:23:25.420  
  to play properly you want to play so
  

01:23:25.420   01:23:27.450  
  to play properly you want to play so
that    play  

01:23:27.450   01:23:27.460  
that   to play
  

01:23:27.460   01:23:30.000  
that   to play
because    win  

01:23:30.000   01:23:30.010  
because   you win
  

01:23:30.010   01:23:32.310  
because   you win
by     largest  

01:23:32.310   01:23:32.320  
by being   invited to play the largest
  

01:23:32.320   01:23:34.530  
by being   invited to play the largest 
   you  

01:23:34.530   01:23:34.540  
   and the way you
  

01:23:34.540   01:23:36.540  
   and the way you
do     fact     that  

01:23:36.540   01:23:36.550  
do that   that
  

01:23:36.550   01:23:38.040  
do that   that
you     play     manner  

01:23:38.040   01:23:38.050  
you can play   manner
  

01:23:38.050   01:23:40.080  
you can play   manner 
   there's  

01:23:40.080   01:23:40.090  
  every time you play even if there's
  

01:23:40.090   01:23:41.970  
  every time you play even if there's
victory     makes  

01:23:41.970   01:23:41.980  
victory at stake and that's what makes
 

01:23:41.980   01:23:44.129  
victory at stake and that's what makes
you     all 

01:23:44.129   01:23:44.139  
you successful across time and we all
 

01:23:44.139   01:23:45.750  
you successful across time and we all
know   that  

01:23:45.750   01:23:45.760  
know   that and we even tell our kids that
  

01:23:45.760   01:23:48.750  
know   that and we even tell our kids that 
   so  

01:23:48.750   01:23:48.760  
   and so
  

01:23:48.760   01:23:51.209  
   and so
we're     game  

01:23:51.209   01:23:51.219  
we're   not adapting ourselves to the game
  

01:23:51.219   01:23:52.919  
we're   not adapting ourselves to the game
and     we're     adapting  

01:23:52.919   01:23:52.929  
and victory in the game   adapting
  

01:23:52.929   01:23:55.109  
and victory in the game   adapting
ourselves    victory  

01:23:55.109   01:23:55.119  
ourselves   metagame and victory
  

01:23:55.119   01:23:57.120  
ourselves   metagame and victory 
   and  

01:23:57.120   01:23:57.130  
  across the set of all possible games and
  

01:23:57.130   01:23:59.820  
  across the set of all possible games and
that's     that's     exactly  

01:23:59.820   01:23:59.830  
that's what that   exactly
  

01:23:59.830   01:24:01.590  
that's what that   exactly
what     as     exactly  

01:24:01.590   01:24:01.600  
   far as I can tell that's exactly
  

01:24:01.600   01:24:03.209  
   far as I can tell that's exactly
what     this     that's  

01:24:03.209   01:24:03.219  
what   that's
  

01:24:03.219   01:24:05.310  
what   that's 
   there's  

01:24:05.310   01:24:05.320  
   there's
  

01:24:05.320   01:24:07.350  
   there's 
   that  

01:24:07.350   01:24:07.360  
   being that
  

01:24:07.360   01:24:10.379  
   being that
transcends     of     of  

01:24:10.379   01:24:10.389  
transcends the   of
  

01:24:10.389   01:24:12.629  
transcends the   of
the     localized     other  

01:24:12.629   01:24:12.639  
the localized   that's the other
  

01:24:12.639   01:24:14.370  
the localized   that's the other
way     to     morally  

01:24:14.370   01:24:14.380  
way to   and to act morally
  

01:24:14.380   01:24:17.850  
way to   and to act morally 
   the  

01:24:17.850   01:24:17.860  
  is not to win today's contest at the
  

01:24:17.860   01:24:20.939  
  is not to win today's contest at the 
   contests

   of possible contests
  

01:24:20.949   01:24:23.129  
   of possible contests 
   something  

01:24:23.129   01:24:23.139  
  and again I don't see that as something
  

01:24:23.139   01:24:25.140  
  and again I don't see that as something
that's    relativistic  

01:24:25.140   01:24:25.150  
that's   arbitrary it's not relativistic
  

01:24:25.150   01:24:28.169  
that's   arbitrary it's not relativistic
there's     absolute

voluntarily accepted the suffering
 

01:25:47.620   01:25:49.470  
voluntarily accepted the suffering
that's     being    what

cowards   well that that's pretty
straightforward    ultimate  

01:26:09.210   01:26:09.220  
straightforward   and what's the ultimate
  

01:26:09.220   01:26:11.640  
straightforward   and what's the ultimate
act     terms  

01:26:11.640   01:26:11.650

across     space     say  

01:26:54.690   01:26:54.700  
across   and Jung would say
  

01:26:54.700   01:26:57.540  
across   and Jung would say
it's     image

  now you know there are elements of it 
   it  

01:27:01.200   01:27:01.210  
  that are culturally constructed it
  

01:27:01.210   01:27:03.000

   all
together     the  

01:28:27.090   01:28:27.100  
  together they can play so they have the
  

01:28:27.100   01:28:29.940  
  together they can play so they have the
knowledge     individually  

01:28:29.940   01:28:29.950

and then   they start to play by the rules
  

01:28:38.200   01:28:40.950  
and then   they start to play by the rules 
   well  

01:28:40.950   01:28:40.960  
   CSA's last step was well
  

01:28:40.960   01:28:42.270  
   CSA's last step was well
they     the  

01:28:42.270   01:28:42.280  
they didn't just the kids play by the
 

01:28:42.280   01:28:43.860  
they didn't just the kids play by the
rules     that    can  

01:28:43.860   01:28:43.870  
rules that   can
  

01:28:43.870   01:28:45.840  
rules that   can
make     rules     that  

01:28:45.840   01:28:45.850  
make the rules   thought about that
  

01:28:45.850   01:28:47.580  
make the rules   thought about that
as     progression     play  

01:28:47.580   01:28:47.590  
as moral progression   first you can play
  

01:28:47.590   01:28:49.680  
as moral progression   first you can play 
   you  

01:28:49.680   01:28:49.690  
   then you
  

01:28:49.690   01:28:51.330  
   then you
learn     didn't     think  

01:28:51.330   01:28:51.340  
learn   think
  

01:28:51.340   01:28:52.650  
learn   think
everyone     this     you're  

01:28:52.650   01:28:52.660  
everyone learned this   that you're
  

01:28:52.660   01:28:54.270  
everyone learned this   that you're 
   that  

01:28:54.270   01:28:54.280  
   that
  

01:28:54.280   01:28:56.850  
   that
doesn't     arbitrary     but  

01:28:56.850   01:28:56.860  
   but
  

01:28:56.860   01:28:59.400  
   but
it    generator  

01:28:59.400   01:28:59.410  
   the generator
  

01:28:59.410   01:29:01.170  
   the generator
of     the     you  

01:29:01.170   01:29:01.180  
of the   you
  

01:29:01.180   01:29:02.400  
of the   you
know    thought  

01:29:02.400   01:29:02.410  
   how to play the game and he thought
  

01:29:02.410   01:29:04.560  
   how to play the game and he thought 
   progression  

01:29:04.560   01:29:04.570  
   that as a moral moral progression
  

01:29:04.570   01:29:05.910  
   that as a moral moral progression
and     exactly  

01:29:05.910   01:29:05.920  
and then   I thought well that's exactly
  

01:29:05.920   01:29:07.920  
and then   I thought well that's exactly 
   story  

01:29:07.920   01:29:07.930  
   happened to Moses in in the story
  

01:29:07.930   01:29:09.480

would follow them   no one was going to
follow     what's  

01:30:56.550   01:30:56.560  
follow   them if they don't match what's
  

01:30:56.560   01:30:58.560  
follow   them if they don't match what's
already     that  

01:30:58.560   01:30:58.570  
already there   you just think about that
  

01:30:58.570   01:31:01.740  
already there   you just think about that
is     unjust     portrayed  

01:31:01.740   01:31:01.750  
is unjust   and so that's that's portrayed
  

01:31:01.750   01:31:04.860  
is unjust   and so that's that's portrayed
here     event     it's  

01:31:04.860   01:31:04.870  
here as a cataclysmic human event   it's
  

01:31:04.870   01:31:07.800  
here as a cataclysmic human event   it's
like     chimpanzees  

01:31:07.800   01:31:07.810  
like oh my god we've been chimpanzees
 

01:31:07.810   01:31:09.090  
like oh my god we've been chimpanzees
we've     of

consciousness     is  

01:31:17.700   01:31:17.710

consciousness and we could say here is
the     by 

01:31:20.520   01:31:20.530  
the law and you say well is it given by
 

01:31:20.530   01:31:23.280  
the law and you say well is it given by
God   mean  

01:31:23.280   01:31:23.290  
God   well hey it depends on what you mean
  

01:31:23.290   01:31:24.810  
God   well hey it depends on what you mean
by     God     that

   that
  

01:31:24.820   01:31:26.430  
   that
presupposition     just  

01:31:26.430   01:31:26.440  
presupposition but it's not like it just
 

01:31:26.440   01:31:28.710  
presupposition but it's not like it just
   this  

01:31:28.710   01:31:28.720  
   nowhere it took it and this
  

01:31:28.720   01:31:31.229  
   nowhere it took it and this
is    so  

01:31:31.229   01:31:31.239  
is   something else Nietzsche observed so
  

01:31:31.239   01:31:32.970  
is   something else Nietzsche observed so
interestingly     that  

01:31:32.970   01:31:32.980  
interestingly and he said you know   that
  

01:31:32.980   01:31:35.640  
interestingly and he said you know   that
a     consequence  

01:31:35.640   01:31:35.650  
  a moral revelation was the consequence
  

01:31:35.650   01:31:39.090  
  a moral revelation was the consequence 
   of  

01:31:39.090   01:31:39.100

   that's his idea of

modernists are so incorrect   you
know     an  

01:33:48.780   01:33:48.790  
know they say   something like there's an
  

01:33:48.790   01:33:50.460  
know they say   something like there's an
infinite     number     of  

01:33:50.460   01:33:50.470  
infinite number   of interpretations of
  

01:33:50.470   01:33:53.100  
infinite number   of interpretations of
the     world     true  

01:33:53.100   01:33:53.110  
the world   and that's actually true
  

01:33:53.110   01:33:55.200  
the world   and that's actually true
but     mistake     they

   and they
  

01:33:55.210   01:33:58.020  
   and they
say     interpretation     be  

01:33:58.020   01:33:58.030  
say well no interpretation   is to be
  

01:33:58.030   01:33:59.820  
say well no interpretation   is to be
privileged     other     interpretation  

01:33:59.820   01:33:59.830  
privileged over   interpretation
  

01:33:59.830   01:34:03.270  
privileged over   interpretation
it's     that's  

01:34:03.270   01:34:03.280  
it's like wrong wrong that's that's

the fabric of reality and they do it
 

01:37:50.180   01:37:52.210  
the fabric of reality and they do it
successfully   snap  

01:37:52.210   01:37:52.220  
successfully   because it doesn't snap
  

01:37:52.220   01:37:54.160

01:38:12.320   01:38:14.260  
that's   it's yeah
because     of  

01:38:14.260   01:38:14.270  
because   you can't twist the fabric of
  

01:38:14.270   01:38:17.830  
because   you can't twist the fabric of
reality     back     it

broader public   attention one of the
  

01:38:46.070   01:38:48.040  
broader public   attention one of the
thing     of     mistake  

01:38:48.040   01:38:48.050  
thing I'd   mistake
  

01:38:48.050   01:38:49.570  
thing I'd   mistake 
   than  

01:38:49.570   01:38:49.580  
  because I certainly know I'm more than

   mistake and
going     made     one  

01:38:53.530   01:38:53.540  
going so far either I haven't made   one
  

01:38:53.540   01:38:55.300  
going so far either I haven't made   one
or     found     it  

01:38:55.300   01:38:55.310  
or no one found   out about it
  

01:38:55.310   01:38:59.260  
or no one found   out about it
so     a

so   but it's like you know we walk on a
very     very  

01:39:01.630   01:39:01.640  
very   thin and narrow edge and we're very
  

01:39:01.640   01:39:03.550  
very   thin and narrow edge and we're very 
   degenerating  

01:39:03.550   01:39:03.560  
  lucky when things aren't degenerating
  

01:39:03.560   01:39:06.160  
  lucky when things aren't degenerating 
   moving

the   case with regard this in the

the   case with regard this in the
question    that  

01:39:48.610   01:39:48.620  
question   period a bit last time is that
  

01:39:48.620   01:39:50.530  
question   period a bit last time is that 
   be  

01:39:50.530   01:39:50.540  
  one of the things that seems to be
  

01:39:50.540   01:39:52.900  
  one of the things that seems to be
actually     gluing  

01:39:52.900   01:39:52.910  
  actually one of the advantages to gluing
  

01:39:52.910   01:39:54.400  
  actually one of the advantages to gluing
the     Old  

01:39:54.400   01:39:54.410  
the New Testament   on to the Old
  

01:39:54.410   01:39:55.960  
the New Testament   on to the Old

01:39:55.960   01:39:55.970  
  Testament is the idea of a
  

01:39:55.970   01:39:57.610  
  Testament is the idea of a
transformation    is  

01:39:57.610   01:39:57.620  
transformation   that is
  

01:39:57.620   01:40:00.190  
transformation   that is
analogous     PIA     that  

01:40:00.190   01:40:00.200  
analogous to   jetty an idea that
  

01:40:00.200   01:40:02.710  
analogous to   jetty an idea that
after     you  

01:40:02.710   01:40:02.720  
after   you learn to play by the rules you
  

01:40:02.720   01:40:04.630  
after   you learn to play by the rules you
can     to     I  

01:40:04.630   01:40:04.640  
can learn to   make the rules because I

can learn to   make the rules because I 
   to  

01:40:06.070   01:40:06.080  
   that's actually what happens to
  

01:40:06.080   01:40:07.540  
   that's actually what happens to
some     between  

01:40:07.540   01:40:07.550  
some degree in the   transition between

you're always going around telling   them
  

01:40:23.000   01:40:24.460  
you're always going around telling   them
to     all  

01:40:24.460   01:40:24.470  
to stop   being so happy because all
  

01:40:24.470   01:40:25.690  
to stop   being so happy because all
they're     causing     it's

they're doing   trouble it's
  

01:40:25.700   01:40:27.220  
they're doing   trouble it's
quite     and     you  

01:40:27.220   01:40:27.230  
quite painful if you're a parent and   you
  

01:40:27.230   01:40:29.110  
quite painful if you're a parent and   you
notice     is  

01:40:29.110   01:40:29.120  
notice that   but the first morality is
  

01:40:29.120   01:40:32.500  
notice that   but the first morality is
prohibition     so  

01:40:32.500   01:40:32.510  
prohibition   right control yourself so
  

01:40:32.510   01:40:33.910  
prohibition   right control yourself so
you    and  

01:40:33.910   01:40:33.920  
you   don't cause too much trouble and
  

01:40:33.920   01:40:36.010  
you   don't cause too much trouble and
then     you     and  

01:40:36.010   01:40:36.020  
then maybe if you   get that down and
  

01:40:36.020   01:40:37.270  
then maybe if you   get that down and
you're     then     is  

01:40:37.270   01:40:37.280  
you're good at   is
  

01:40:37.280   01:40:40.000  
you're good at   is 
   you  

01:40:40.000   01:40:40.010  
   then you
  

01:40:40.010   01:40:41.140  
   then you
can     start     something  

01:40:41.140   01:40:41.150  
can start   something
  

01:40:41.150   01:40:43.000  
can start   something 
   the  

01:40:43.000   01:40:43.010  
  that's a positive good and that's the
  

01:40:43.010   01:40:44.620  
  that's a positive good and that's the 
   be  

01:40:44.620   01:40:44.630  
   that seems to me to be
  

01:40:44.630   01:40:46.770  
   that seems to me to be
fundamentally     the  

01:40:46.770   01:40:46.780  
fundamentally characteristic of the
 

01:40:46.780   01:40:48.790  
fundamentally characteristic of the
juxtaposition     the    to  

01:40:48.790   01:40:48.800  
juxtaposition of the   New Testament on to
  

01:40:48.800   01:40:50.650  
juxtaposition of the   New Testament on to
the     is  

01:40:50.650   01:40:50.660  
the Old   Testament but in these images is
  

01:40:50.660   01:40:53.080  
the Old   Testament but in these images is
still     tradition  

01:40:53.080   01:40:53.090  
still something   like serve tradition
  

01:40:53.090   01:40:57.430  
still something   like serve tradition
serve     the     psychologically  

01:40:57.430   01:40:57.440  
serve the   father psychologically
  

01:40:57.440   01:41:00.420  
serve the   father psychologically 
   because  

01:41:00.420   01:41:00.430  
  speaking support the tradition because
  

01:41:00.430   01:41:02.770

01:42:35.200   01:42:35.210  
exactly   like we're the hobbits and
  

01:42:35.210   01:42:37.780  
exactly   like we're the hobbits and 
   by  

01:42:37.780   01:42:37.790  
  there are we are protected from chaos by
  

01:42:37.790   01:42:39.760  
  there are we are protected from chaos by
the     and  

01:42:39.760   01:42:39.770  
the spirits of our   dead ancestors and
  

01:42:39.770   01:42:41.950  
the spirits of our   dead ancestors and
we're     damn     we  

01:42:41.950   01:42:41.960  
we're too damn   and we
  

01:42:41.960   01:42:43.330  
we're too damn   and we 
   anymore  

01:42:43.330   01:42:43.340  
   anymore
  

01:42:43.340   01:42:45.160  
   anymore
and     post-modernism  

01:42:45.160   01:42:45.170  
and   that to me that's post-modernism
  

01:42:45.170   01:42:46.660  
and   that to me that's post-modernism
that's     are  

01:42:46.660   01:42:46.670  
that's what the bloody universities are
 

01:42:46.670   01:42:48.580  
that's what the bloody universities are
doing   absolutely  

01:42:48.580   01:42:48.590  
doing   with the humanities to absolutely
  

01:42:48.590   01:42:51.460  
doing   with the humanities to absolutely
appalling    so  

01:42:51.460   01:42:51.470  
appalling   and we will pay for it so
  

01:42:51.470   01:42:53.650  
appalling   and we will pay for it so
unless     hopefully     we'll  

01:42:53.650   01:42:53.660  
unless we wake up and   we'll
  

01:42:53.660   01:42:55.090  
unless we wake up and   we'll
wake     better  

01:42:55.090   01:42:55.100  
wake up   because that would be better
  

01:42:55.100   01:42:56.800  
wake up   because that would be better 
   being  

01:42:56.800   01:42:56.810  
   being
  

01:42:56.810   01:43:00.490  
   being
awake     well     then  

01:43:00.490   01:43:00.500  
awake   so so then
  

01:43:00.500   01:43:02.680  
awake   so so then
I     of  

01:43:02.680   01:43:02.690  
I had this vision one time and I   kind of
  

01:43:02.690   01:43:05.050  
I had this vision one time and I   kind of
portrayed     of  

01:43:05.050   01:43:05.060  
portrayed it in this   in this image of
  

01:43:05.060   01:43:07.630  
portrayed it in this   in this image of
what     was     thought  

01:43:07.630   01:43:07.640  
what the world was   like and I thought
  

01:43:07.640   01:43:09.670  
what the world was   like and I thought
well     not     a  

01:43:09.670   01:43:09.680  
well it's not   a pyramid it's not a
  

01:43:09.680   01:43:12.040  
well it's not   a pyramid it's not a
single     authority     not  

01:43:12.040   01:43:12.050  
single hierarchy of authority   not
  

01:43:12.050   01:43:13.690  
single hierarchy of authority   not
what     it's     of  

01:43:13.690   01:43:13.700  
what it is it's it's   an array of
  

01:43:13.700   01:43:15.880  
what it is it's it's   an array of 
   imagine  

01:43:15.880   01:43:15.890  
  hierarchies of authority so you imagine
  

01:43:15.890   01:43:18.070  
  hierarchies of authority so you imagine 
   the  

01:43:18.070   01:43:18.080  
   sort of infinite plane and the
  

01:43:18.080   01:43:19.930  
   sort of infinite plane and the
the    but  

01:43:19.930   01:43:19.940  
the   plane there's nothing but
  

01:43:19.940   01:43:21.580  
the   plane there's nothing but
pyramids     there  

01:43:21.580   01:43:21.590  
pyramids and inside the pyramids there
 

01:43:21.590   01:43:24.670  
pyramids and inside the pyramids there
are     everywhere    as  

01:43:24.670   01:43:24.680  
are strata of people everywhere   far as
  

01:43:24.680   01:43:26.080  
are strata of people everywhere   far as 
   are  

01:43:26.080   01:43:26.090  
   the pyramids are
  

01:43:26.090   01:43:28.330  
   the pyramids are
tall    overlap  

01:43:28.330   01:43:28.340  
tall   some of them are short they overlap
  

01:43:28.340   01:43:30.880  
tall   some of them are short they overlap
it's     the     and  

01:43:30.880   01:43:30.890  
it's endless   plain is endless and
  

01:43:30.890   01:43:33.010  
it's endless   plain is endless and
those     all     you  

01:43:33.010   01:43:33.020  
those are all   the positions to which you
  

01:43:33.020   01:43:35.350  
those are all   the positions to which you
could     the  

01:43:35.350   01:43:35.360  
could rise   and everybody's inside the
  

01:43:35.360   01:43:37.330  
could rise   and everybody's inside the
pyramid     to  

01:43:37.330   01:43:37.340  
pyramid sort of crammed up trying   to
  

01:43:37.340   01:43:39.130  
pyramid sort of crammed up trying   to
move     there's  

01:43:39.130   01:43:39.140  
move towards the top   and then there's
  

01:43:39.140   01:43:41.020  
move towards the top   and then there's
the     possibility     over  

01:43:41.020   01:43:41.030  
the possibility   of sailing across over
  

01:43:41.030   01:43:43.510  
the possibility   of sailing across over 
   the  

01:43:43.510   01:43:43.520  
   of them and seeing how the
  

01:43:43.520   01:43:45.460  
   of them and seeing how the
structure    and  

01:43:45.460   01:43:45.470  
structure   itself works and that's and
  

01:43:45.470   01:43:47.380  
structure   itself works and that's and 
   the  

01:43:47.380   01:43:47.390  
   the
  

01:43:47.390   01:43:49.390  
   the
pyramid     the     itself  

01:43:49.390   01:43:49.400  
   structure itself
  

01:43:49.400   01:43:51.970  
   structure itself
and     is     to  

01:43:51.970   01:43:51.980  
and the highest order   not to
  

01:43:51.980   01:43:54.280  
and the highest order   not to
be     top     use  

01:43:54.280   01:43:54.290  
be at the top   it's to use
  

01:43:54.290   01:43:56.590  
be at the top   it's to use
the     discipline     by  

01:43:56.590   01:43:56.600  
the discipline   that you attain by
  

01:43:56.600   01:43:58.630  
the discipline   that you attain by 
   pyramid  

01:43:58.630   01:43:58.640  
   pyramid
  

01:43:58.640   01:44:01.150  
   pyramid
to     yourself     and  

01:44:01.150   01:44:01.160  
to release yourself   from the pyramid and
  

01:44:01.160   01:44:03.430  
to release yourself   from the pyramid and 
   think  

01:44:03.430   01:44:03.440  
   think
  

01:44:03.440   01:44:04.390  
   think 
   that's  

01:44:04.390   01:44:04.400  
  that's one of the things that's
  

01:44:04.400   01:44:06.610  
  that's one of the things that's
instantiated     of     for  

01:44:06.610   01:44:06.620  
instantiated in the idea of   the for
  

01:44:06.620   01:44:12.250  
instantiated in the idea of   the for 
   think  

01:44:12.250   01:44:12.260  
  example of the Holy Ghost so and I think
  

01:44:12.260   01:44:13.960  
  example of the Holy Ghost so and I think 
   and  

01:44:13.960   01:44:13.970  
  that's akin to that that's Sisyphus and
  

01:44:13.970   01:44:16.030  
  that's akin to that that's Sisyphus and 
   remember  

01:44:16.030   01:44:16.040  
  needs a set of Sisyphus if I remember
  

01:44:16.040   01:44:18.100  
  needs a set of Sisyphus if I remember
correctly    him  

01:44:18.100   01:44:18.110  
correctly   that one has to imagine him
  

01:44:18.110   01:44:20.710  
correctly   that one has to imagine him
happy     the  

01:44:20.710   01:44:20.720  
happy well if there's a rock at the
 

01:44:20.720   01:44:22.390  
happy well if there's a rock at the
   as  

01:44:22.390   01:44:22.400  
   hill then you might as
  

01:44:22.400   01:44:23.860  
   hill then you might as
well     rolls  

01:44:23.860   01:44:23.870  
well   push it up the hill and if it rolls
  

01:44:23.870   01:44:25.330  
well   push it up the hill and if it rolls 
   something  

01:44:25.330   01:44:25.340  
   got something
  

01:44:25.340   01:44:26.980  
   got something 
   damn  

01:44:26.980   01:44:26.990  
   don't you can push the damn
  

01:44:26.990   01:44:28.510  
   don't you can push the damn
rock     and     no  

01:44:28.510   01:44:28.520  
rock back up the hill and   there's no
  

01:44:28.520   01:44:31.240  
rock back up the hill and   there's no 
   up  

01:44:31.240   01:44:31.250  
   up to push up
  

01:44:31.250   01:44:32.650  
   up to push up 
   for  

01:44:32.650   01:44:32.660  
   that's what we're built for
  

01:44:32.660   01:44:35.200  
   that's what we're built for
anyways     like  

01:44:35.200   01:44:35.210  
anyways and   so let's go out and like
  

01:44:35.210   01:44:36.940  
anyways and   so let's go out and like
push     and  

01:44:36.940   01:44:36.950  
push   some damn boulders up the hill and
  

01:44:36.950   01:44:38.020  
push   some damn boulders up the hill and 
   enough  

01:44:38.020   01:44:38.030  
  then maybe we could have enough
  

01:44:38.030   01:44:40.120  
  then maybe we could have enough
self-confidence     enough  

01:44:40.120   01:44:40.130  
self-confidence   and enough enough
  

01:44:40.130   01:44:41.890  
self-confidence   and enough enough 
   wouldn't  

01:44:41.890   01:44:41.900  
   wouldn't
  

01:44:41.900   01:44:43.990  
   wouldn't 
   and  

01:44:43.990   01:44:44.000  
   to turn to hatred and revenge and
  

01:44:44.000   01:44:45.550  
   to turn to hatred and revenge and 
   I  

01:44:45.550   01:44:45.560  
  try to take everything down because I
  

01:44:45.560   01:44:49.030  
  try to take everything down because I
think     the     not  

01:44:49.030   01:44:49.040  
think   alternative so he's not
  

01:44:49.040   01:44:50.800  
think   alternative so he's not
weak     one     about  

01:44:50.800   01:44:50.810  
weak   thing you can say about
  

01:44:50.810   01:44:55.570  
weak   thing you can say about 
   there  

01:44:55.570   01:44:55.580  
  him the same idea represented there
  

01:44:55.580   01:44:57.100  
  him the same idea represented there
right     voluntarily  

01:44:57.100   01:44:57.110  
right that's   outlets who voluntarily
  

01:44:57.110   01:44:58.870  
right that's   outlets who voluntarily
takes     shoulders     it's  

01:44:58.870   01:44:58.880  
takes the   it's
  

01:44:58.880   01:44:59.950  
takes the   it's
like     Christ  

01:44:59.950   01:44:59.960  
like the   idea of Christ
  

01:44:59.960   01:45:01.810  
like the   idea of Christ
taking     the     his  

01:45:01.810   01:45:01.820  
taking the sins of the   world on his
  

01:45:01.820   01:45:03.580  
taking the sins of the   world on his
shoulders    notion  

01:45:03.580   01:45:03.590  
   exactly the same notion
  

01:45:03.590   01:45:05.770  
   exactly the same notion 
   be  

01:45:05.770   01:45:05.780  
   you should be
  

01:45:05.780   01:45:07.900  
   you should be
able     yourself     the  

01:45:07.900   01:45:07.910  
able to   all the
  

01:45:07.910   01:45:10.030  
able to   all the
horror     take  

01:45:10.030   01:45:10.040  
horror of humanity and take
 

01:45:10.040   01:45:11.890  
horror of humanity and take
responsibility   that's  

01:45:11.890   01:45:11.900  
responsibility   that's
  

01:45:11.900   01:45:13.600  
responsibility   that's
what     so  

01:45:13.600   01:45:13.610  
  what that means and the thing that's so
  

01:45:13.610   01:45:14.920  
  what that means and the thing that's so
interesting     about     you  

01:45:14.920   01:45:14.930  
interesting   if you
  

01:45:14.930   01:45:17.290  
interesting   if you 
   all  

01:45:17.290   01:45:17.300  
  can recognize yourself in yourself all
  

01:45:17.300   01:45:19.180  
  can recognize yourself in yourself all
the     horror     will  

01:45:19.180   01:45:19.190  
the horror   of humanity you will
  

01:45:19.190   01:45:20.470  
the horror   of humanity you will 
   more  

01:45:20.470   01:45:20.480  
  instantly have a hell of a lot more
  

01:45:20.480   01:45:22.120  
  instantly have a hell of a lot more 
   before  

01:45:22.120   01:45:22.130  
   did before
  

01:45:22.130   01:45:24.130  
   did before 
   real  

01:45:24.130   01:45:24.140  
   there's some real
  

01:45:24.140   01:45:25.330  
   there's some real
utility    a  

01:45:25.330   01:45:25.340

  metaphor the most real things about life
are     the  

01:52:16.160   01:52:16.170  
are the place you   don't know and the

are the place you   don't know and the
place     well  

01:52:18.260   01:52:18.270  
place   you know and you could say well
  

01:52:18.270   01:52:19.939  
place   you know and you could say well
that's     unexplored  

01:52:19.939   01:52:19.949  
that's explored territory and unexplored
 

01:52:19.949   01:52:21.800  
that's explored territory and unexplored
territory   been  

01:52:21.800   01:52:21.810  
territory   that's real and it's been
  

01:52:21.810   01:52:23.300  
territory   that's real and it's been

back     you     put  

01:52:24.919   01:52:24.929  
back to the lobsters you   know if you put
  

01:52:24.929   01:52:26.270  
back to the lobsters you   know if you put
lobsters     in     first

lobsters in   their new place the first 
   their  

01:52:27.649   01:52:27.659  
   go around their
  

01:52:27.659   01:52:29.359  
   go around their
territory     finding     and  

01:52:29.359   01:52:29.369  
territory finding   places to hide and
  

01:52:29.369   01:52:31.729  
territory finding   places to hide and
also     a     thing  

01:52:31.729   01:52:31.739  
also making   so the first thing
  

01:52:31.739   01:52:34.390  
also making   so the first thing
they     do     know  

01:52:34.390   01:52:34.400  
they do   is establish what they know
  

01:52:34.400   01:52:36.649  
they do   is establish what they know
against     and     that's  

01:52:36.649   01:52:36.659  
against what they don't know and   that's
  

01:52:36.659   01:52:38.660  
against what they don't know and   that's
real    Darwinian  

01:52:38.660   01:52:38.670  
real   it's real from the Darwinian
  

01:52:38.670   01:52:40.280  
real   it's real from the Darwinian
perspective     say     that  

01:52:40.280   01:52:40.290  
perspective and we're going   that
  

01:52:40.290   01:52:41.419  
perspective and we're going   that
what's     from     Darwinian  

01:52:41.419   01:52:41.429  
what's real from   the Darwinian
  

01:52:41.429   01:52:43.100  
what's real from   the Darwinian
perspective     enough  

01:52:43.100   01:52:43.110  
perspective is plenty real enough
 

01:52:43.110   01:52:44.839  
perspective is plenty real enough
because     alive    and  

01:52:44.839   01:52:44.849  
because we're alive   and
  

01:52:44.849   01:52:46.729  
because we're alive   and
so    well  

01:52:46.729   01:52:46.739  
   like well
  

01:52:46.739   01:52:48.709  
   like well
that's     symbol  

01:52:48.709   01:52:48.719  
that's what this   is the Taoist symbol
  

01:52:48.719   01:52:50.810  
that's what this   is the Taoist symbol 
   it  

01:52:50.810   01:52:50.820  
  that's what it says is that what way it
  

01:52:50.820   01:52:53.350  
  that's what it says is that what way it
says     of  

01:52:53.350   01:52:53.360  
says what is experience made of
 

01:52:53.360   01:52:57.290  
says what is experience made of
eternally   order  

01:52:57.290   01:52:57.300  
eternally   that's easy chaos and order
  

01:52:57.300   01:52:59.930  
eternally   that's easy chaos and order 
   the  

01:52:59.930   01:52:59.940  
  and in every bit of chaos there's the
  

01:52:59.940   01:53:01.820  
  and in every bit of chaos there's the 
   of  

01:53:01.820   01:53:01.830  
   of
  

01:53:01.830   01:53:03.290  
   of
order     the     chaos  

01:53:03.290   01:53:03.300  
order there's the   possibility of chaos
  

01:53:03.300   01:53:05.540  
order there's the   possibility of chaos
and     path  

01:53:05.540   01:53:05.550  
and that's the way right that's the path
 

01:53:05.550   01:53:07.669  
and that's the way right that's the path
of     and    where  

01:53:07.669   01:53:07.679  
of life that's life itself and   where
  

01:53:07.679   01:53:08.930  
of life that's life itself and   where
you're     the  

01:53:08.930   01:53:08.940  
you're supposed to   be is right on the
  

01:53:08.940   01:53:10.729  
you're supposed to   be is right on the
border     the     why  

01:53:10.729   01:53:10.739  
border   and why
  

01:53:10.739   01:53:14.120  
border   and why
is     enough  

01:53:14.120   01:53:14.130  
is that stable enough   engaged enough
  

01:53:14.130   01:53:17.180  
is that stable enough   engaged enough
right     you  

01:53:17.180   01:53:17.190  
right so not   only are you doing what you
  

01:53:17.190   01:53:18.620  
right so not   only are you doing what you 
   way  

01:53:18.620   01:53:18.630  
   you're doing in a way
  

01:53:18.630   01:53:20.209  
   you're doing in a way
that     increases     that  

01:53:20.209   01:53:20.219  
that increases   that
  

01:53:20.219   01:53:22.399  
that increases   that
you'll     you     can  

01:53:22.399   01:53:22.409  
you'll do it better tomorrow   can
  

01:53:22.409   01:53:23.830  
you'll do it better tomorrow   can
tell     because  

01:53:23.830   01:53:23.840  
tell when you're doing that because
 

01:53:23.840   01:53:26.540  
tell when you're doing that because
you're   time  

01:53:26.540   01:53:26.550  
you're   time
  

01:53:26.550   01:53:30.500  
you're   time
and     place     tells  

01:53:30.500   01:53:30.510  
   your your neurology tells
  

01:53:30.510   01:53:33.290  
   your your neurology tells
you     that's  

01:53:33.290   01:53:33.300  
you that that's what   meaning is that's
  

01:53:33.300   01:53:35.419  
you that that's what   meaning is that's
what     that's  

01:53:35.419   01:53:35.429  
what transcendent meaning   is and that's
  

01:53:35.429   01:53:37.160  
what transcendent meaning   is and that's
so     cool     that  

01:53:37.160   01:53:37.170  
so   because I also think that that
  

01:53:37.170   01:53:39.830  
so   because I also think that that
is     the     suffering  

01:53:39.830   01:53:39.840  
is the   suffering
  

01:53:39.840   01:53:42.229  
is the   suffering
the     is  

01:53:42.229   01:53:42.239  
the antidote to existential   suffering is
  

01:53:42.239   01:53:43.820  
the antidote to existential   suffering is
to    right  

01:53:43.820   01:53:43.830  
to   at the right
  

01:53:43.830   01:53:46.459  
to   at the right
time    get  

01:53:46.459   01:53:46.469  
time   to get
  

01:53:46.469   01:53:48.709  
time   to get 
   pain  

01:53:48.709   01:53:48.719  
   it okay anxiety and pain
  

01:53:48.719   01:53:51.620  
   it okay anxiety and pain 
   of  

01:53:51.620   01:53:51.630  
  that's the cause that's the reality of
  

01:53:51.630   01:53:52.220  
  that's the cause that's the reality of 
   existential  

01:53:52.220   01:53:52.230  
  the existential
  

01:53:52.230   01:53:54.650  
  the existential 
   in  

01:53:54.650   01:53:54.660  
   okay so let's say you're in
  

01:53:54.660   01:53:56.450  
   okay so let's say you're in
the     right     what  

01:53:56.450   01:53:56.460  
the   place at the right time what
  

01:53:56.460   01:53:57.760  
the   place at the right time what
happens     biochemically  

01:53:57.760   01:53:57.770  
happens to you biochemically
 

01:53:57.770   01:54:00.290  
happens to you biochemically
dopaminergic     activation    that  

01:54:00.290   01:54:00.300  
dopaminergic activation   what does that
  

01:54:00.300   01:54:00.970  
dopaminergic activation   what does that
do 

01:54:00.970   01:54:00.980  
do
 

01:54:00.980   01:54:04.430  
do
suppresses     anxiety    analgesic  

01:54:04.430   01:54:04.440  
suppresses anxiety   analgesic
  

01:54:04.440   01:54:05.930  
suppresses anxiety   analgesic
now     more     also  

01:54:05.930   01:54:05.940  
now it's more   that because also
  

01:54:05.940   01:54:07.940  
now it's more   that because also
produces    desire  

01:54:07.940   01:54:07.950  
   positive emotion and the desire
  

01:54:07.950   01:54:09.620  
   positive emotion and the desire 
   underlies  

01:54:09.620   01:54:09.630  
  to move forward and it underlies
  

01:54:09.630   01:54:12.800  
  to move forward and it underlies
creativity    you  

01:54:12.800   01:54:12.810  
creativity   you
  

01:54:12.810   01:54:14.420  
creativity   you
get     engagement     a  

01:54:14.420   01:54:14.430  
get the   from a
  

01:54:14.430   01:54:16.160  
get the   from a
neurochemical     the  

01:54:16.160   01:54:16.170  
neurochemical perspective you get the
 

01:54:16.170   01:54:19.160  
neurochemical perspective you get the
analgesia   and  

01:54:19.160   01:54:19.170  
analgesia   anti end and
  

01:54:19.170   01:54:21.500  
analgesia   anti end and
you     of     it's  

01:54:21.500   01:54:21.510  
you get   anxiety so it's
  

01:54:21.510   01:54:23.990  
you get   anxiety so it's
not     case  

01:54:23.990   01:54:24.000  
not   hypothetical it's and it is the case
  

01:54:24.000   01:54:25.910  
not   hypothetical it's and it is the case
that    are  

01:54:25.910   01:54:25.920  
that   the dopaminergic systems those are
  

01:54:25.920   01:54:27.740  
that   the dopaminergic systems those are
the     unbelievably  

01:54:27.740   01:54:27.750  
the exploratory systems   unbelievably
  

01:54:27.750   01:54:30.260  
the exploratory systems   unbelievably
ancient     when  

01:54:30.260   01:54:30.270  
ancient and archaic are activated   when
  

01:54:30.270   01:54:33.560  
ancient and archaic are activated   when 
   be

  you're optimally positioned to be to be

   did that you know we
have     if     we  

01:55:02.810   01:55:02.820  
have no idea what we could do if   we
  

01:55:02.820   01:55:04.850  
have no idea what we could do if   we
started     things     maybe

started   and maybe
  

01:55:04.860   01:55:06.500

   so the Daoists well what is this
  

01:55:31.260   01:55:33.650  
   so the Daoists well what is this
well     chaos  

01:55:33.650   01:55:33.660  
well this   is the pre cosmogonic chaos
  

01:55:33.660   01:55:35.900  
well this   is the pre cosmogonic chaos
out     the     extracted  

01:55:35.900   01:55:35.910  
out of which the   extracted

and    chaos  

01:55:41.470   01:55:41.480  
and   that chaos
  

01:55:41.480   01:55:43.970  
and   that chaos 
   I  

01:55:43.970   01:55:43.980  
   that later I
  

01:55:43.980   01:55:45.410  
   that later I
guess     complicated  

01:55:45.410   01:55:45.420  
guess because it's a very complicated
 

01:55:45.420   01:55:47.840  
guess because it's a very complicated
   certainly  

01:55:47.840   01:55:47.850  
   it's certainly
  

01:55:47.850   01:55:50.180  
   it's certainly
the     when     the  

01:55:50.180   01:55:50.190  
the   you encounter the
  

01:55:50.190   01:55:51.680  
the   you encounter the
chaos     encounter     the  

01:55:51.680   01:55:51.690  
chaos is   when the
  

01:55:51.690   01:55:55.190  
chaos is   when the
Twin     remember     what  

01:55:55.190   01:55:55.200  
Twin Towers fall right   what
  

01:55:55.200   01:55:58.160  
Twin Towers fall right   what
that     like     was  

01:55:58.160   01:55:58.170  
that   right so it was it was
  

01:55:58.170   01:56:00.410  
that   right so it was it was 
   world  

01:56:00.410   01:56:00.420  
  September 10th well that was the world
  

01:56:00.420   01:56:01.850  
  September 10th well that was the world 
   like  

01:56:01.850   01:56:01.860  
   like
  

01:56:01.860   01:56:03.770  
   like
and     and  

01:56:03.770   01:56:03.780  
and then it was   September 11th and
  

01:56:03.780   01:56:05.599  
and then it was   September 11th and
everyone     day  

01:56:05.599   01:56:05.609  
everyone walked around day
 

01:56:05.609   01:56:08.810  
everyone walked around day
for     the    building's  

01:56:08.810   01:56:08.820  
for three days because the   building's
  

01:56:08.820   01:56:12.439  
for three days because the   building's
failed     a  

01:56:12.439   01:56:12.449  
  failed but so what you can see a
  

01:56:12.449   01:56:14.839  
  failed but so what you can see a 
   what  

01:56:14.839   01:56:14.849  
  building fall you can understand what
  

01:56:14.849   01:56:16.489  
  building fall you can understand what
it's     when     falls  

01:56:16.489   01:56:16.499  
it's what happens when   falls
  

01:56:16.499   01:56:18.319  
it's what happens when   falls
so     being  

01:56:18.319   01:56:18.329  
so then what's going   on with the being
  

01:56:18.329   01:56:20.839  
so then what's going   on with the being
dazed     underlies  

01:56:20.839   01:56:20.849  
dazed well   it's the chaos that underlies
  

01:56:20.849   01:56:22.099  
dazed well   it's the chaos that underlies 
   manifested  

01:56:22.099   01:56:22.109  
   have manifested
  

01:56:22.109   01:56:24.199  
   have manifested 
   a  

01:56:24.199   01:56:24.209  
   collapse was a
  

01:56:24.209   01:56:26.359  
   collapse was a
brilliant     everyone  

01:56:26.359   01:56:26.369  
brilliant act of terrorism   and everyone
  

01:56:26.369   01:56:29.479  
brilliant act of terrorism   and everyone
was     frozen     that's  

01:56:29.479   01:56:29.489  
was frozen   and curious because that's
  

01:56:29.489   01:56:31.339  
was frozen   and curious because that's
how     thing     the  

01:56:31.339   01:56:31.349  
how we react to   the
  

01:56:31.349   01:56:33.770  
how we react to   the
it's     like     know  

01:56:33.770   01:56:33.780  
it's like it's like   the shark you know

terrible   Leviathan shark underneath
coming     out     that's  

01:56:44.899   01:56:44.909  
coming up   well that's
  

01:56:44.909   01:56:47.239  
coming up   well that's
life     man     and

the world   is extracted and then you're
  

01:57:07.139   01:57:10.969  
the world   is extracted and then you're 
   the

real     I     the  

01:57:25.369   01:57:25.379  
real than anything else   think the
  

01:57:25.379   01:57:27.979  
real than anything else   think the
reason     has  

01:57:27.979   01:57:27.989  
reason   for that in part is that this has
  

01:57:27.989   01:57:31.489  
reason   for that in part is that this has
been     been     as  

01:57:31.489   01:57:31.499  
been it's been   as
  

01:57:31.499   01:57:34.099  
been it's been   as
long    been  

01:57:34.099   01:57:34.109  
long   as there's been life this has been
  

01:57:34.109   01:57:37.819  
long   as there's been life this has been
the     cosmos  

01:57:37.819   01:57:37.829  
the rule of life   and that's the cosmos
  

01:57:37.829   01:57:39.919  
the rule of life   and that's the cosmos 
   inhabit  

01:57:39.919   01:57:39.929  
   what we inhabit
  

01:57:39.929   01:57:42.290  
   what we inhabit 
   the  

01:57:42.290   01:57:42.300  
  and so one of the things you know the
  

01:57:42.300   01:57:44.989  
  and so one of the things you know the
the     they  

01:57:44.989   01:57:44.999  
the   so-called New Atheists and I they
  

01:57:44.999   01:57:46.849  
the   so-called New Atheists and I they 
   New  

01:57:46.849   01:57:46.859  
  don't want to go on a tangent about New
  

01:57:46.859   01:57:48.739  
  don't want to go on a tangent about New
Atheists     are  

01:57:48.739   01:57:48.749  
Atheists because I think atheists are
 

01:57:48.749   01:57:50.419  
Atheists because I think atheists are
often     and    very  

01:57:50.419   01:57:50.429  
often remarkably honest and   very
  

01:57:50.429   01:57:55.579  
often remarkably honest and   very
consistent     I  

01:57:55.579   01:57:55.589  
consistent in their   analysis so but I
  

01:57:55.589   01:57:56.719  
consistent in their   analysis so but I
just     they're     the  

01:57:56.719   01:57:56.729  
just   taking the
  

01:57:56.729   01:57:58.520  
just   taking the
problem     seriously     don't  

01:57:58.520   01:57:58.530  
problem seriously   don't
  

01:57:58.530   01:57:59.770  
problem seriously   don't 
   evolutionary  

01:57:59.770   01:57:59.780  
  think they take their evolutionary
  

01:57:59.780   01:58:03.169  
  think they take their evolutionary
theorizing     seriousness

to transform the enemy into the dragon
 

02:05:54.170   02:05:56.169  
to transform the enemy into the dragon
right     enemy    the  

02:05:56.169   02:05:56.179  
right because the enemy   is often the
  

02:05:56.179   02:05:57.820  
right because the enemy   is often the

predator   instantaneously
  

02:05:57.830   02:06:00.160  
predator   instantaneously
right     thought     so  

02:06:00.160   02:06:00.170  
   and so
  

02:06:00.170   02:06:01.570  
   and so
then     can     because  

02:06:01.570   02:06:01.580  
then we can   war morally because
  

02:06:01.580   02:06:04.689  
then we can   war morally because 
   you  

02:06:04.689   02:06:04.699  
   well you

now here are   some pictures that
  

02:06:53.720   02:06:56.500  
now here are   some pictures that
demonstrate     the

demonstrate what I had described as the
emergence     the    out  

02:06:58.720   02:06:58.730  
emergence of let's say the   meta hero out

emergence of let's say the   meta hero out
of     you  

02:07:00.640   02:07:00.650  
of   the hero so there's the person you
  

02:07:00.650   02:07:02.260  
of   the hero so there's the person you 
   of  

02:07:02.260   02:07:02.270  
  admire and then there's the set of
  

02:07:02.270   02:07:03.940  
  admire and then there's the set of
people    there's  

02:07:03.940   02:07:03.950  
people   you admire and then there's
  

02:07:03.950   02:07:06.640  
people   you admire and then there's
the     the  

02:07:06.640   02:07:06.650  
the meta set of admirable people   and the
  

02:07:06.650   02:07:08.980  
the meta set of admirable people   and the
extraction     ideal     can  

02:07:08.980   02:07:08.990  
extraction of that ideal   as far as I can
  

02:07:08.990   02:07:10.960  
extraction of that ideal   as far as I can
tell     in  

02:07:10.960   02:07:10.970  
tell   that's just what's portrayed in
  

02:07:10.970   02:07:22.150  
tell   that's just what's portrayed in
these     it's  

02:07:22.150   02:07:22.160  
these   images that's a great one it's
  

02:07:22.160   02:07:23.740  
these   images that's a great one it's
very    that  

02:07:23.740   02:07:23.750  
very   sophisticated image you see that

for one   right
you     think     the  

02:09:55.940   02:09:55.950  
you know and I think   one of the
  

02:09:55.950   02:09:57.770

conundrums   is a
  

02:09:57.780   02:09:59.150  
conundrums   is a
tough    women  

02:09:59.150   02:09:59.160  
tough   is why I think women
  

02:09:59.160   02:10:00.650  
tough   is why I think women
are     in     and  

02:10:00.650   02:10:00.660  
are higher in   trade agreeableness and
  

02:10:00.660   02:10:02.330  
are higher in   trade agreeableness and 
   is  

02:10:02.330   02:10:02.340  
  higher and trade negative emotion is
  

02:10:02.340   02:10:05.390  
  higher and trade negative emotion is 
   a  

02:10:05.390   02:10:05.400  
  that you know the primary problem that a
  

02:10:05.400   02:10:07.250  
  that you know the primary problem that a
woman     not

throw it out a   it's very
  

02:10:09.000   02:10:10.880  
throw it out a   it's very 
   the  

02:10:10.880   02:10:10.890  
   mean it's there all the
  

02:10:10.890   02:10:12.560  
   mean it's there all the 
   it's  

02:10:12.560   02:10:12.570  
   it's constant demand it's
  

02:10:12.570   02:10:14.570  
   it's constant demand it's
absolutely     tremendous  

02:10:14.570   02:10:14.580  
absolutely constant amount tremendous
 

02:10:14.580   02:10:17.630  
absolutely constant amount tremendous
dependency     so    be  

02:10:17.630   02:10:17.640  
dependency and so   to be
  

02:10:17.640   02:10:20.000  
dependency and so   to be 
   looks  

02:10:20.000   02:10:20.010  
  tilted towards mercy that's how it looks
  

02:10:20.010   02:10:22.220  
  tilted towards mercy that's how it looks 
   it's  

02:10:22.220   02:10:22.230  
   especially during it's
  

02:10:22.230   02:10:23.990  
   especially during it's
so     the     the  

02:10:23.990   02:10:24.000  
so important during the   the
  

02:10:24.000   02:10:25.310  
so important during the   the
first     children     so  

02:10:25.310   02:10:25.320  
first   are so
  

02:10:25.320   02:10:27.170  
first   are so
unbelievably     vulnerable     think  

02:10:27.170   02:10:27.180  
unbelievably vulnerable   and so I think
  

02:10:27.180   02:10:29.030  
unbelievably vulnerable   and so I think
it's    be  

02:10:29.030   02:10:29.040  
it's   very difficult for women to be
  

02:10:29.040   02:10:31.610  
it's   very difficult for women to be
merciful     shift  

02:10:31.610   02:10:31.620  
merciful like that and to make   the shift
  

02:10:31.620   02:10:34.700  
merciful like that and to make   the shift
to     think  

02:10:34.700   02:10:34.710  
to encouraging disciplinarian   I think
  

02:10:34.710   02:10:36.020  
to encouraging disciplinarian   I think
that's     people  

02:10:36.020   02:10:36.030  
that's a   very difficult thing for people
  

02:10:36.030   02:10:39.200  
that's a   very difficult thing for people 
   know  

02:10:39.200   02:10:39.210  
  to do simultaneously although you know
  

02:10:39.210   02:10:41.570  
  to do simultaneously although you know
people     women  

02:10:41.570   02:10:41.580  
people people   I'm not saying that women
  

02:10:41.580   02:10:43.430  
people people   I'm not saying that women
are     are  

02:10:43.430   02:10:43.440  
  are always only merciful and men are
  

02:10:43.440   02:10:45.560  
  are always only merciful and men are
always     disciplinarians  

02:10:45.560   02:10:45.570  
always   only encouraging disciplinarians
  

02:10:45.570   02:10:47.630  
always   only encouraging disciplinarians 
   to  

02:10:47.630   02:10:47.640  
  but things do sort themselves out to
  

02:10:47.640   02:10:49.310  
  but things do sort themselves out to
some     also  

02:10:49.310   02:10:49.320  
some degree   like that and I think also
  

02:10:49.320   02:10:51.620  
some degree   like that and I think also
the    that  

02:10:51.620   02:10:51.630  
the   that
  

02:10:51.630   02:10:53.750  
the   that
accompany     childbirth     and  

02:10:53.750   02:10:53.760  
accompany pregnancy and childbirth   and
  

02:10:53.760   02:10:56.120  
accompany pregnancy and childbirth   and
lactation     towards  

02:10:56.120   02:10:56.130  
lactation also   tilt a mother towards
  

02:10:56.130   02:10:57.950  
lactation also   tilt a mother towards
that     that  

02:10:57.950   02:10:57.960  
that as well   we have to really love that
  

02:10:57.960   02:10:58.970  
that as well   we have to really love that 
   right  

02:10:58.970   02:10:58.980  
  little thing right
  

02:10:58.980   02:11:01.280  
  little thing right
it's    it  

02:11:01.280   02:11:01.290  
it's   one no matter what it
  

02:11:01.290   02:11:03.710  
it's   one no matter what it
demands     what     do  

02:11:03.710   02:11:03.720  
demands and then telling it what   to do
  

02:11:03.720   02:11:05.030  
demands and then telling it what   to do
and     making     properly  

02:11:05.030   02:11:05.040  
and making   properly
  

02:11:05.040   02:11:06.860  
and making   properly
that's     issue  

02:11:06.860   02:11:06.870  
that's that's a whole   different issue
  

02:11:06.870   02:11:10.060  
that's that's a whole   different issue 
   mean  

02:11:10.060   02:11:10.070  
  now but the kids who lack fathers I mean
  

02:11:10.070   02:11:12.260  
  now but the kids who lack fathers I mean

02:11:12.260   02:11:12.270  
first   all they can find that to some
  

02:11:12.270   02:11:14.000  
first   all they can find that to some 
   often  

02:11:14.000   02:11:14.010  
   their friends and that's often
  

02:11:14.010   02:11:15.860  
   their friends and that's often
what    they  

02:11:15.860   02:11:15.870  
what   particular they
  

02:11:15.870   02:11:19.280  
what   particular they
go     the  

02:11:19.280   02:11:19.290  
go into gangs   and they generate the
  

02:11:19.290   02:11:21.680

   and
you     one     we're  

02:11:54.590   02:11:54.600  
   of the things that we're
  

02:11:54.600   02:11:56.240  
   of the things that we're
doing     think     I  

02:11:56.240   02:11:56.250  
doing in our society which   is I
  

02:11:56.250   02:11:59.060  
doing in our society which   is I 
   that  

02:11:59.060   02:11:59.070  
  think it's absolutely appalling is that
  

02:11:59.070   02:12:01.130  
  think it's absolutely appalling is that
we're     case     families  

02:12:01.130   02:12:01.140  
we're   that all families
  

02:12:01.140   02:12:05.270  
we're   that all families 
   then  

02:12:05.270   02:12:05.280  
   then
  

02:12:05.280   02:12:06.950  
   then
there's     supporting  

02:12:06.950   02:12:06.960  
there's no   empirical data supporting
  

02:12:06.960   02:12:08.480  
there's no   empirical data supporting
that     much  

02:12:08.480   02:12:08.490  
that proposition   by the way it's much
  

02:12:08.490   02:12:10.340  
that proposition   by the way it's much
better    know  

02:12:10.340   02:12:10.350  
better   two parents know
  

02:12:10.350   02:12:11.990  
better   two parents know
who     whole  

02:12:11.990   02:12:12.000  
who those parents   are that's a whole
  

02:12:12.000   02:12:13.580  
who those parents   are that's a whole 
   just  

02:12:13.580   02:12:13.590  
   okay and if I could just
  

02:12:13.590   02:12:16.010  
   okay and if I could just 
   ask  

02:12:16.010   02:12:16.020  
   would you ask
  

02:12:16.020   02:12:17.390  
   would you ask 
   daughter  

02:12:17.390   02:12:17.400  
   question so let's see a daughter
  

02:12:17.400   02:12:19.130  
   question so let's see a daughter 
   she  

02:12:19.130   02:12:19.140  
   she
  

02:12:19.140   02:12:20.510  
   she
would    to  

02:12:20.510   02:12:20.520  
would   all see have different ways to
  

02:12:20.520   02:12:21.830  
would   all see have different ways to
find    missing  

02:12:21.830   02:12:21.840  
find   of her missing
  

02:12:21.840   02:12:23.480  
find   of her missing 
   instead  

02:12:23.480   02:12:23.490  
   instead
  

02:12:23.490   02:12:24.470  
   instead
because     raised  

02:12:24.470   02:12:24.480  
because obviously they're raised
 

02:12:24.480   02:12:25.820  
because obviously they're raised
differently   have  

02:12:25.820   02:12:25.830  
differently   at least they should have
  

02:12:25.830   02:12:27.830  
differently   at least they should have
been     issue  

02:12:27.830   02:12:27.840  
been well I think it's the same issue
 

02:12:27.840   02:12:30.440  
been well I think it's the same issue
   another  

02:12:30.440   02:12:30.450  
  you know I mean I think that another
  

02:12:30.450   02:12:32.450  
  you know I mean I think that another
danger     of  

02:12:32.450   02:12:32.460  
danger that emerges mrs. Freud's of
 

02:12:32.460   02:12:34.610  
danger that emerges mrs. Freud's of
course   you  

02:12:34.610   02:12:34.620  
course   that you
  

02:12:34.620   02:12:37.400  
course   that you
know     were  

02:12:37.400   02:12:37.410  
know if there's mom and   child were
  

02:12:37.410   02:12:39.380  
know if there's mom and   child were
father    can  

02:12:39.380   02:12:39.390  
father   can
  

02:12:39.390   02:12:41.150  
father   can
get    and  

02:12:41.150   02:12:41.160  
get   a little closer than it should and
  

02:12:41.160   02:12:43.670  
get   a little closer than it should and
then     and  

02:12:43.670   02:12:43.680  
then the lines get blurry and mixed and
 

02:12:43.680   02:12:45.560  
then the lines get blurry and mixed and
   to  

02:12:45.560   02:12:45.570  
  I'm not saying that that happens to
  

02:12:45.570   02:12:47.720  
  I'm not saying that that happens to
everyone     a  

02:12:47.720   02:12:47.730  
everyone   obviously but but it's still a
  

02:12:47.730   02:12:49.520  
everyone   obviously but but it's still a
danger     the  

02:12:49.520   02:12:49.530  
danger that   that's inherent in the
  

02:12:49.530   02:12:51.650  
danger that   that's inherent in the
situation     too  

02:12:51.650   02:12:51.660  
situation they're thrust together   too
  

02:12:51.660   02:12:54.710  
situation they're thrust together   too
tightly     without     and  

02:12:54.710   02:12:54.720  
tightly   and
  

02:12:54.720   02:12:56.420  
tightly   and
so     responsibility     be  

02:12:56.420   02:12:56.430  
so the responsibility   has to be
  

02:12:56.430   02:12:58.310  
so the responsibility   has to be
distributed     I     do  

02:12:58.310   02:12:58.320  
   really do
  

02:12:58.320   02:12:59.630  
   really do 
   the  

02:12:59.630   02:12:59.640  
   that it's the sign of the
  

02:12:59.640   02:13:02.450  
   that it's the sign of the
degeneration     that  

02:13:02.450   02:13:02.460  
degeneration   of the society when that
  

02:13:02.460   02:13:05.090  
degeneration   of the society when that
when     when     becomes  

02:13:05.090   02:13:05.100  
when when   single parenthood becomes
  

02:13:05.100   02:13:07.760  
when when   single parenthood becomes 
   not  

02:13:07.760   02:13:07.770  
   it's not
  

02:13:07.770   02:13:08.420  
   it's not
a     good     idea  

02:13:08.420   02:13:08.430  
a good   idea
  

02:13:08.430   02:13:10.430  
a good   idea
then     part     I  

02:13:10.430   02:13:10.440  
then the and part   I
  

02:13:10.440   02:13:12.230

be reborn   that
  

02:16:19.380   02:16:21.860  
be reborn   that
means    psychological  

02:16:21.860   02:16:21.870  
means   of this is psychological
  

02:16:21.870   02:16:24.260  
means   of this is psychological
and     simplest  

02:16:24.260   02:16:24.270  
  and symbolic and that's the simplest
  

02:16:24.270   02:16:28.400  
  and symbolic and that's the simplest
answer     satisfied     that  

02:16:28.400   02:16:28.410  
answer but I'm not satisfied   with that
  

02:16:28.410   02:16:30.380  
answer but I'm not satisfied   with that
answer    coherent  

02:16:30.380   02:16:30.390  
   it's coherent
  

02:16:30.390   02:16:32.720

fundamental   but just about resulted in
  

02:19:30.570   02:19:31.889  
fundamental   but just about resulted in

  girl these are not trivial issues and
we're    and  

02:19:37.620   02:19:37.630  
we're   insane boat and
  

02:19:37.630   02:19:40.109  
we're   insane boat and
so     do     about  

02:19:40.109   02:19:40.119  
so what do   be done about
  

02:19:40.119   02:19:42.779  
so what do   be done about 
   way  

02:19:42.779   02:19:42.789  
   well I thought about that way
  

02:19:42.789   02:19:44.849  
   well I thought about that way 
   think  

02:19:44.849   02:19:44.859  
   and I think
  

02:19:44.859   02:19:48.000  
   and I think 
   we  

02:19:48.000   02:19:48.010  
   it is we
  

02:19:48.010   02:19:50.699  
   it is we 
   there  

02:19:50.699   02:19:50.709  
   because there
  

02:19:50.709   02:19:52.170  
   because there
isn't     more     that  

02:19:52.170   02:19:52.180  
isn't   powerful than that
  

02:19:52.180   02:19:54.540  
isn't   powerful than that
and     that's     answer  

02:19:54.540   02:19:54.550  
and that's   the right theological answer
  

02:19:54.550   02:19:57.779  
and that's   the right theological answer 
   good  

02:19:57.779   02:19:57.789  
  because the spoken truth brings good
  

02:19:57.789   02:20:01.080

   way the the part of the
  

02:26:06.761   02:26:09.121  
   way the the part of the

02:26:09.121   02:26:09.131  
attraction   of Christianity but this was

attraction   of Christianity but this was

02:26:11.220   02:26:11.230  
   emerged across time was
  

02:26:11.230   02:26:13.230  
   emerged across time was
the     a  

02:26:13.230   02:26:13.240  
the notion   that even if you were in a
  

02:26:13.240   02:26:15.241  
the notion   that even if you were in a
lowly     position     something  

02:26:15.241   02:26:15.251  
lowly position   that there was something
  

02:26:15.251   02:26:17.131  
lowly position   that there was something 
   divine  

02:26:17.131   02:26:17.141  
   the divine
  

02:26:17.141   02:26:19.201  
   the divine 
   just  

02:26:19.201   02:26:19.211  
  and now you might say well that's just
  

02:26:19.211   02:26:21.031  
  and now you might say well that's just 
   would  

02:26:21.031   02:26:21.041  
   would
  

02:26:21.041   02:26:22.711  
   would
say    the  

02:26:22.711   02:26:22.721  
say   that's what Marx would say right the
  

02:26:22.721   02:26:24.930  
say   that's what Marx would say right the
opiate     masses     yesterday  

02:26:24.930   02:26:24.940  
opiate of the masses   tweeted yesterday
  

02:26:24.940   02:26:26.161  
opiate of the masses   tweeted yesterday
something    funny  

02:26:26.161   02:26:26.171  
something   funny
  

02:26:26.171   02:26:29.461  
something   funny
which     that     the  

02:26:29.461   02:26:29.471  
which was that   the
  

02:26:29.471   02:26:31.741  
which was that   the
opiate     Marxism  

02:26:31.741   02:26:31.751  
opiate of the masses but that Marxism
 

02:26:31.751   02:26:33.720  
opiate of the masses but that Marxism
was     of 

02:26:33.720   02:26:33.730  
was the methamphetamine of the max of
 

02:26:33.730   02:26:37.680  
was the methamphetamine of the max of
the     masses    the  

02:26:37.680   02:26:37.690  
the masses   so so so I think the
  

02:26:37.690   02:26:41.220  
the masses   so so so I think the
attraction     it     allowed  

02:26:41.220   02:26:41.230  
attraction was   it allowed
  

02:26:41.230   02:26:43.411  
attraction was   it allowed
people    intrinsic  

02:26:43.411   02:26:43.421  
people   to recognize their intrinsic
  

02:26:43.421   02:26:45.121  
people   to recognize their intrinsic
dignity    been  

02:26:45.121   02:26:45.131  
   and one of the things I've been
  

02:26:45.131   02:26:46.770  
   and one of the things I've been 
   juxtaposition  

02:26:46.770   02:26:46.780  
   about is the juxtaposition
  

02:26:46.780   02:26:49.680  
   about is the juxtaposition 
   because  

02:26:49.680   02:26:49.690  
   and Genesis 2 because
  

02:26:49.690   02:26:51.241  
   and Genesis 2 because 
   human  

02:26:51.241   02:26:51.251  
   in Genesis 2 is that human
  

02:26:51.251   02:26:53.400  
   in Genesis 2 is that human
beings    then  

02:26:53.400   02:26:53.410  
beings   collapse and fall right and then
  

02:26:53.410   02:26:55.020  
beings   collapse and fall right and then
were     evil  

02:26:55.020   02:26:55.030  
were   these fallen creatures that no evil
  

02:26:55.030   02:26:58.531  
were   these fallen creatures that no evil 
   it's  

02:26:58.531   02:26:58.541  
  but in the beginning in Genesis 1 it's
  

02:26:58.541   02:27:00.360  
  but in the beginning in Genesis 1 it's
really     optimistic     it  

02:27:00.360   02:27:00.370  
really   story because it
  

02:27:00.370   02:27:02.041  
really   story because it
says     of     creatures  

02:27:02.041   02:27:02.051  
says well we're the sorts of   creatures
  

02:27:02.051   02:27:03.810  
says well we're the sorts of   creatures
that     of  

02:27:03.810   02:27:03.820  
  that partake in the calling forth of
  

02:27:03.820   02:27:06.091  
  that partake in the calling forth of
being     chaos     our  

02:27:06.091   02:27:06.101  
being from chaos   and then that's in our
  

02:27:06.101   02:27:07.890  
being from chaos   and then that's in our
essential     if  

02:27:07.890   02:27:07.900  
essential nature and to some degree if
 

02:27:07.900   02:27:10.201  
essential nature and to some degree if
you     if 

02:27:10.201   02:27:10.211  
you juxtapose both of those it's as if
 

02:27:10.211   02:27:13.531  
you juxtapose both of those it's as if
   rammed  

02:27:13.531   02:27:13.541  
  that's the entire biblical story rammed
  

02:27:13.541   02:27:15.270  
  that's the entire biblical story rammed
together     two     which  

02:27:15.270   02:27:15.280  
together in the first two   chapters which
  

02:27:15.280   02:27:16.890  
together in the first two   chapters which
is     partly     to  

02:27:16.890   02:27:16.900  
is partly   why we're taking so long to
  

02:27:16.900   02:27:18.991  
is partly   why we're taking so long to
get     is     to  

02:27:18.991   02:27:19.001  
get through this by the way is   that to
  

02:27:19.001   02:27:22.591  
get through this by the way is   that to
return     Genesis     to  

02:27:22.591   02:27:22.601  
return to Genesis   is the antidote to
  

02:27:22.601   02:27:25.291  
return to Genesis   is the antidote to 
   act  

02:27:25.291   02:27:25.301  
  Genesis 2 it's like to continue to act
  

02:27:25.301   02:27:27.451  
  Genesis 2 it's like to continue to act
out     made     in  

02:27:27.451   02:27:27.461  
out the   in
  

02:27:27.461   02:27:29.820  
out the   in
God's     image     you're  

02:27:29.820   02:27:29.830  
God's image   you're
  

02:27:29.830   02:27:32.581  
God's image   you're
you're     being  

02:27:32.581   02:27:32.591  
you're capable   of speaking good being
  

02:27:32.591   02:27:35.220  
you're capable   of speaking good being
into     that  

02:27:35.220   02:27:35.230  
into existence through truth and that
 

02:27:35.230   02:27:36.871  
into existence through truth and that
that's     also    fall  

02:27:36.871   02:27:36.881  
that's also   the antidote to the fall
  

02:27:36.881   02:27:38.281  
that's also   the antidote to the fall
which     the  

02:27:38.281   02:27:38.291  
which i think   is actually the
  

02:27:38.291   02:27:41.371  
which i think   is actually the
fundamental     the  

02:27:41.371   02:27:41.381  
fundamental narrative message of the
 

02:27:41.381   02:27:43.081  
fundamental narrative message of the
entire     and    also  

02:27:43.081   02:27:43.091  
entire biblical structure and   I also
  

02:27:43.091   02:27:44.791  
entire biblical structure and   I also
think    that  

02:27:44.791   02:27:44.801  
think   civilization for that
  

02:27:44.801   02:27:48.600  
think   civilization for that
matter     is

matter   so there's a nobility and this is
  

02:27:48.610   02:27:50.581

also     fundamentally  

02:27:50.581   02:27:50.591  
also   I think Nietzsche was fundamentally
  

02:27:50.591   02:27:52.201  
also   I think Nietzsche was fundamentally
wrong     his     Christianity  

02:27:52.201   02:27:52.211  
wrong in his   criticism with Christianity
  

02:27:52.211   02:27:53.461  
wrong in his   criticism with Christianity
because     he     slaves  

02:27:53.461   02:27:53.471  
because he   slaves

you know the   the bottom
  

02:27:56.171   02:27:59.161  
you know the   the bottom
against     the     historical  

02:27:59.161   02:27:59.171  
against the   talk that's more historical
  

02:27:59.171   02:28:00.331  
against the   talk that's more historical 
   theological  

02:28:00.331   02:28:00.341

so     the

requires     just  

02:28:10.921   02:28:10.931  
requires   responsibility so it's not just
  

02:28:10.931   02:28:12.780  
requires   responsibility so it's not just

02:28:12.780   02:28:12.790  
   wish
  

02:28:12.790   02:28:15.030

02:28:15.030   02:28:15.040  
   which I
  

02:28:15.040   02:28:17.761  
   which I
thought     my

thought about   a lot is not tenable in my
  

02:28:17.771   02:28:19.440  
thought about   a lot is not tenable in my
estimation     for  

02:28:19.440   02:28:19.450  
estimation it also   doesn't account for
  

02:28:19.450   02:28:21.180  
estimation it also   doesn't account for
the    it's  

02:28:21.180   02:28:21.190  
the   because if it's
  

02:28:21.190   02:28:23.220  
the   because if it's
only     with  

02:28:23.220   02:28:23.230  
only wish fulfillment   why bother with
  

02:28:23.230   02:28:26.070  
only wish fulfillment   why bother with 
   you're  

02:28:26.070   02:28:26.080  
   lot more if you're
  

02:28:26.080   02:28:27.540

fight against your   worm-like fragile
mortal     existence     of  

02:28:52.461   02:28:52.471  
mortal existence   is the possibility of
  

02:28:52.471   02:28:55.140  
mortal existence   is the possibility of
transcending     of  

02:28:55.140   02:28:55.150  
transcending that   with nobility of
  

02:28:55.150   02:28:57.660  
transcending that   with nobility of

02:29:11.320   02:29:13.290  
that that's   a reasonable criticism but
the     the  

02:29:13.290   02:29:13.300  
the consequence of not bearing the

don't know feel familiar with the words
of   familiar  

02:29:32.380   02:29:32.390

that   idea
  

02:29:39.620   02:29:42.220  
that   idea
that     people  

02:29:42.220   02:29:42.230  
that   people and especially modern people
  

02:29:42.230   02:29:45.460  
that   people and especially modern people
have     unknown  

02:29:45.460   02:29:45.470  
have a failure to recognize   the unknown
  

02:29:45.470   02:29:49.720  
have a failure to recognize   the unknown
unknowns     yeah     a  

02:29:49.720   02:29:49.730  
unknowns   such yes right that's a
  

02:29:49.730   02:29:51.280  
unknowns   such yes right that's a
good     about     you  

02:29:51.280   02:29:51.290  
good   can you
  

02:29:51.290   02:29:52.810  
good   can you 
   can  

02:29:52.810   02:29:52.820  
  move the mic up a bit so that people can
  

02:29:52.820   02:29:55.090  
  move the mic up a bit so that people can
hear     little     yes  

02:29:55.090   02:29:55.100  
hear   yes
  

02:29:55.100   02:29:58.990  
hear   yes
um     well     think  

02:29:58.990   02:29:59.000  
um   I was wondering do you think
  

02:29:59.000   02:30:03.070  
um   I was wondering do you think 
   some  

02:30:03.070   02:30:03.080  
  that that failure might might be in some
  

02:30:03.080   02:30:05.950  
  that that failure might might be in some 
   modern  

02:30:05.950   02:30:05.960  
   modern
  

02:30:05.960   02:30:09.370  
   modern
people    God  

02:30:09.370   02:30:09.380  
people   to relate to the idea of God
  

02:30:09.380   02:30:15.780  
people   to relate to the idea of God
so     your     can't  

02:30:15.780   02:30:15.790  
so in the sense that your   people can't
  

02:30:15.790   02:30:19.120  
so in the sense that your   people can't 
   I  

02:30:19.120   02:30:19.130  
  really grapple with the notion of God I
  

02:30:19.130   02:30:20.920  
  really grapple with the notion of God I 
   rational  

02:30:20.920   02:30:20.930  
  think as much as you can give a rational
  

02:30:20.930   02:30:22.690  
  think as much as you can give a rational 
   the  

02:30:22.690   02:30:22.700  
   you can't feel God in the
  

02:30:22.700   02:30:24.940  
   you can't feel God in the
way     person  

02:30:24.940   02:30:24.950  
way that perhaps a more religious person
 

02:30:24.950   02:30:29.350  
way that perhaps a more religious person
   felt  

02:30:29.350   02:30:29.360  
   felt
  

02:30:29.360   02:30:32.070  
   felt
God     inability     to  

02:30:32.070   02:30:32.080  
   to
  

02:30:32.080   02:30:35.440  
   to
recognize    might  

02:30:35.440   02:30:35.450  
recognize   the unknown unknowns might
  

02:30:35.450   02:30:39.430  
recognize   the unknown unknowns might
play     so  

02:30:39.430   02:30:39.440  
play into   that yeah well they're okay so
  

02:30:39.440   02:30:41.500  
play into   that yeah well they're okay so
that     related     of  

02:30:41.500   02:30:41.510  
that seems   of
  

02:30:41.510   02:30:43.900  
that seems   of
the     that's  

02:30:43.900   02:30:43.910  
the absence of necessity   that's
  

02:30:43.910   02:30:46.120  
the absence of necessity   that's
something     like     I  

02:30:46.120   02:30:46.130  
something like   that is that no because I
  

02:30:46.130   02:30:47.590  
something like   that is that no because I 
   you're  

02:30:47.590   02:30:47.600  
  think that I think that what you're
  

02:30:47.600   02:30:50.320  
  think that I think that what you're
you're     if  

02:30:50.320   02:30:50.330  
you're   making a claim maybe tell me if
  

02:30:50.330   02:30:52.870  
you're   making a claim maybe tell me if
I've     it     you're  

02:30:52.870   02:30:52.880  
I've got it   that if you're
  

02:30:52.880   02:30:57.040  
I've got it   that if you're
sheltered     then     also  

02:30:57.040   02:30:57.050  
sheltered too much then   it also it also
  

02:30:57.050   02:30:58.630  
sheltered too much then   it also it also
separates     that's  

02:30:58.630   02:30:58.640  
separates you from anything that's
 

02:30:58.640   02:31:00.460  
separates you from anything that's
divine   right  

02:31:00.460   02:31:00.470  
divine   I guess that might be right
  

02:31:00.470   02:31:01.870  
divine   I guess that might be right 
   of  

02:31:01.870   02:31:01.880  
  because there's not enough intensity of
  

02:31:01.880   02:31:03.130  
  because there's not enough intensity of
the     something     that

   Lost I think about as
like     a     precursor  

02:31:52.121   02:31:52.131  
like a precursor a   prophetic precursor

to the emergence of totalitarian   states
in     think  

02:31:55.780   02:31:55.790  
in the modern world   and so yeah I think
  

02:31:55.790   02:31:59.320  
in the modern world   and so yeah I think
that    know  

02:31:59.320   02:31:59.330  
that   you can believe that what you know
  

02:31:59.330   02:32:03.011  
that   you can believe that what you know
is     what  

02:32:03.011   02:32:03.021  
is sufficient to banish permanently what
 

02:32:03.021   02:32:04.751  
is sufficient to banish permanently what
you     that 

02:32:04.751   02:32:04.761  
you don't know and I do think that that
 

02:32:04.761   02:32:07.480  
you don't know and I do think that that
   think  

02:32:07.480   02:32:07.490  
  does paradoxically although you think
  

02:32:07.490   02:32:08.890  
  does paradoxically although you think
that     also  

02:32:08.890   02:32:08.900  
that that   would make you secure it also

speaking most of the time you can   get
rid     differences  

02:34:33.310   02:34:33.320  
rid of the attitudinal differences
 

02:34:33.320   02:34:35.081  
rid of the attitudinal differences
between     women    reduce  

02:34:35.081   02:34:35.091  
between men and women   or at least reduce
  

02:34:35.091   02:34:37.091  
between men and women   or at least reduce
them    so  

02:34:37.091   02:34:37.101  
them   so
  

02:34:37.101   02:34:38.440  
them   so
if     a  

02:34:38.440   02:34:38.450  
if you take   a feminine man and a
  

02:34:38.450   02:34:41.440  
if you take   a feminine man and a
masculine     the  

02:34:41.440   02:34:41.450  
masculine   woman then you know that the
  

02:34:41.450   02:34:44.501  
masculine   woman then you know that the 
   be  

02:34:44.501   02:34:44.511  
   be
  

02:34:44.511   02:34:46.030  
   be
the     and  

02:34:46.030   02:34:46.040  
the case with political correctness   and
  

02:34:46.040   02:34:47.801  
the case with political correctness   and
so     lot  

02:34:47.801   02:34:47.811  
so I've   been thinking about that a lot
  

02:34:47.811   02:34:50.680  
so I've   been thinking about that a lot
because     bailing     the  

02:34:50.680   02:34:50.690  
because well men   the
  

02:34:50.690   02:34:53.051  
because well men   the
humanities     out  

02:34:53.051   02:34:53.061  
humanities like mad and pretty much out
 

02:34:53.061   02:34:54.761  
humanities like mad and pretty much out
of   the  

02:34:54.761   02:34:54.771  
of   universities except for stem the
  

02:34:54.771   02:34:57.041  
of   universities except for stem the
women     moving     they're  

02:34:57.041   02:34:57.051  
women are moving   in like mad and they're
  

02:34:57.051   02:34:58.990  
women are moving   in like mad and they're
also    sphere  

02:34:58.990   02:34:59.000  
also   sphere
  

02:34:59.000   02:35:00.700  
also   sphere
like     this     we've  

02:35:00.700   02:35:00.710  
like   is new right we've
  

02:35:00.710   02:35:02.440  
like   is new right we've
never     happen     do  

02:35:02.440   02:35:02.450  
never   we do
  

02:35:02.450   02:35:03.850  
never   we do 
   the  

02:35:03.850   02:35:03.860  
   no do not know what the
  

02:35:03.860   02:35:05.890  
   no do not know what the 
   years  

02:35:05.890   02:35:05.900  
   it is it's only 50 years
  

02:35:05.900   02:35:08.140  
   it is it's only 50 years
old     this  

02:35:08.140   02:35:08.150  
old   and so we were thinking about this
  

02:35:08.150   02:35:10.001  
old   and so we were thinking about this
and     about  

02:35:10.001   02:35:10.011  
and so I don't   know what you think about
  

02:35:10.011   02:35:10.870  
and so I don't   know what you think about
this     proposition  

02:35:10.870   02:35:10.880  
this   proposition
  

02:35:10.880   02:35:13.660  
this   proposition
but     historically  

02:35:13.660   02:35:13.670  
but   imagine that that historically
  

02:35:13.670   02:35:17.350  
but   imagine that that historically
speaking    were  

02:35:17.350   02:35:17.360  
speaking   it's something like women were
  

02:35:17.360   02:35:19.179  
speaking   it's something like women were
responsible     and     men  

02:35:19.179   02:35:19.189  
responsible for distribution and   men
  

02:35:19.189   02:35:21.030  
responsible for distribution and   men
were     responsible     production  

02:35:21.030   02:35:21.040  
were responsible   for production
  

02:35:21.040   02:35:23.650  
were responsible   for production 
   maybe  

02:35:23.650   02:35:23.660  
  something like that and maybe maybe
  

02:35:23.660   02:35:25.900  
  something like that and maybe maybe 
   tight  

02:35:25.900   02:35:25.910  
  that's only the case really in the tight
  

02:35:25.910   02:35:27.610  
  that's only the case really in the tight
confines     immediate     but  

02:35:27.610   02:35:27.620  
confines of the immediate   family but
  

02:35:27.620   02:35:29.139  
confines of the immediate   family but 
   most  

02:35:29.139   02:35:29.149  
   most
  

02:35:29.149   02:35:30.820

did was make sure   that everybody got
  

02:35:34.340   02:35:37.480  
did was make sure   that everybody got
enough     to     be

one of the   driving at
  

02:35:39.290   02:35:42.490  
one of the   driving at

least in part   SJW demand for for
equity     make  

02:35:44.500   02:35:44.510  
equity   and equality it's like let's make
  

02:35:44.510   02:35:46.870  
equity   and equality it's like let's make
sure     everybody     both  

02:35:46.870   02:35:46.880  
sure   has enough it's like both
  

02:35:46.880   02:35:48.340  
sure   has enough it's like both
look     you  

02:35:48.340   02:35:48.350  
look fair enough you know I mean you
 

02:35:48.350   02:35:50.139  
look fair enough you know I mean you
can't   that  

02:35:50.139   02:35:50.149  
can't   you can't argue with that
  

02:35:50.149   02:35:52.660  
can't   you can't argue with that
but     between  

02:35:52.660   02:35:52.670  
but there's there's   an antipathy between
  

02:35:52.670   02:35:55.990  
but there's there's   an antipathy between 
   differential  

02:35:55.990   02:35:56.000  
   of differential
  

02:35:56.000   02:35:57.550  
   of differential
productivity     know     people  

02:35:57.550   02:35:57.560  
productivity   because people
  

02:35:57.560   02:35:59.170  
productivity   because people
really     productivity  

02:35:59.170   02:35:59.180  
really do differ in their productivity
 

02:35:59.180   02:36:02.380  
really do differ in their productivity

02:36:02.380   02:36:02.390  
   so to answer your question
  

02:36:02.390   02:36:05.560  
   so to answer your question
fully     rebellious  

02:36:05.560   02:36:05.570  
fully   I do think that the rebellious
  

02:36:05.570   02:36:08.080  
fully   I do think that the rebellious
tendency     associated  

02:36:08.080   02:36:08.090  
tendency of   adolescence is associated
  

02:36:08.090   02:36:09.670  
tendency of   adolescence is associated
both     spike  

02:36:09.670   02:36:09.680  
both with that criminality   spike
  

02:36:09.680   02:36:11.440  
both with that criminality   spike
especially     creativity  

02:36:11.440   02:36:11.450  
especially among men   and with creativity
  

02:36:11.450   02:36:14.920  
especially among men   and with creativity 
   is  

02:36:14.920   02:36:14.930  
  yes I think that the SJW phenomena is
  

02:36:14.930   02:36:16.840  
  yes I think that the SJW phenomena is
different     and     associated  

02:36:16.840   02:36:16.850  
different and   I think it is associated

female political   philosophy would be
  

02:36:40.670   02:36:43.570  
female political   philosophy would be
like     it's  

02:36:43.570   02:36:43.580  
like but it might be   especially if it's
  

02:36:43.580   02:36:45.250  
like but it might be   especially if it's 
   very  

02:36:45.250   02:36:45.260  
   very
  

02:36:45.260   02:36:46.810  
   very
sophisticated     conceptually     could  

02:36:46.810   02:36:46.820  
sophisticated conceptually   it could
  

02:36:46.820   02:36:48.460  
sophisticated conceptually   it could
easily     make     things  

02:36:48.460   02:36:48.470  
easily be well   sure things
  

02:36:48.470   02:36:51.310  
easily be well   sure things
are     but  

02:36:51.310   02:36:51.320  
are   distributed equally well yeah but
  

02:36:51.320   02:36:52.960  
are   distributed equally well yeah but
sorry     not     do  

02:36:52.960   02:36:52.970  
sorry that's that's just   going to do

sorry that's that's just   going to do
you     the

  you fly do you think in terms of the
rest     about  

02:36:57.429   02:36:57.439  
rest of   this JW's and you talked about
  

02:36:57.439   02:36:59.920  
rest of   this JW's and you talked about 
   when  

02:36:59.920   02:36:59.930  
  last lecture as well creating chaos when
  

02:36:59.930   02:37:01.450  
  last lecture as well creating chaos when
there     static  

02:37:01.450   02:37:01.460  
there is none otherwise   it'd be static
  

02:37:01.460   02:37:03.130  
there is none otherwise   it'd be static 
   validity  

02:37:03.130   02:37:03.140  
  do you think there would be any validity
  

02:37:03.140   02:37:05.560  
  do you think there would be any validity 
   Canada  

02:37:05.560   02:37:05.570  
   like Canada
  

02:37:05.570   02:37:08.710  
   like Canada 
   any

  merit to thinking sjw's are trying to
create     even     arguably

create chaos   when they're arguably
  

02:37:13.850   02:37:16.030  
create chaos   when they're arguably 
   obviously

   obviously
  

02:37:16.040   02:37:17.679  
   obviously
there's     still     do  

02:37:17.679   02:37:17.689  
there's still   why would they do
  

02:37:17.689   02:37:20.200  
there's still   why would they do
that    and  

02:37:20.200   02:37:20.210  
that   static and
